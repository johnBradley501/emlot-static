# EMLoT Static Site Creation Tools
This repo contains the files that have been created to enable a dynamic searching component within the static publication of EMLoT.  In the past, many of the pages that EmLoT generated from its web application could function as relatively simple static HTML pages.  And, indeed, in the "static page" version of the site, a great majority of the pages, such as those displaying information about persons, events, etc, are represented exactly as relatively simple static web pages (collected from the functioning web app using the application "SiteSucker": https://ricks-apps.com/osx/sitesucker/index.html

However, these generated pages, by themselves, enabled no dynamic interaction with a user, meaning that there was in the basic static version no searching or browsing mechanisms that the server-driven EMLoT application had provided. As a consequence, it was decided to recreate the searching/browsing mechanisms by the use of Javascript which would operate wholely in the browser.  Most of the code here supports the creation of this browser based searching/browsing mechanism.  These materials can be found in the static site at `/db/browse`: the "Keyword Search" and "Browse" (a facetted browsing mechanism) tabs.
