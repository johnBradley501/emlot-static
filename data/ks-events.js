His bill of complaint provides details of the Newington lease and property. \r\n\r\nSavage claims that Hicks and Honingborne have conspired by underhanded means to deprive him of the property. His interest in the property, he explains, derives from Richard Thompson, who originally held a nineteen-year lease on the property. On 25 March 1576, Hicks granted Savage's request for a thirty-year lease on the property, for the sum of \u00a310 and a yearly rent of four marks, due quarterly at four terms. A proviso in the lease granted Hicks the right to repossess the property 'if the said rent or any part thereof were behind in part or in all at any feast or day aforesaid wherein the said rent ought to be paid and by fourteen days after, being lawfully demanded.' Hicks, in the interest of repossessing the property for his son-in-law, now claims that Honingborne has a right in the property based on a grant ante-dating Savage's lease. Fearing, however, that this factitious lease may not be sufficient to defeat Savage's claim, Hicks and Honingborne have devised a further plot to dispossess Savage, as follows. At the feast of the annunciation, Savage left his quarterly rent in the charge of Thomas Whaston, with the order to pay the sum to Hicks when called upon. Aware of Savage's absence, Hicks deliberately avoided the house for the first thirteen days of the pay-period; Honingborne visited on the fourteenth day, when he knew that Whaston had gone to London. Claiming default of rent, Honingborne immediately took control of the property, and refused to yield or accept the money when Whaston returned and offered to pay. Honingborne again refused the rent when Whaston visited him at home, but subsequently received it through his wife, and has it now in his possession.

More provides a brief account of the transfer of the lease through various hands. He first let the house to Sir Henry Neville for twenty-one years and thereafter, at Neville's request, to Richard Farrant on condition that he not transfer the lease without More's permission. Farrant claimed to use the house only to teach the children, but in fact used it as a playhouse, to the detriment of  both the neighbourhood and the house itself. Farrant also breached the contract in letting part of the house. After Farrant's death, More took possession of the house and accepted rent only conditionally. After refusing to go to court against More over the lease, Anne Farrant sublet the property to William Hunnis, and then Newman or Sutton (he does not remember which), then to Henry Evans, who sold his interest to the Earl of Oxford, who gave his to John Lyly. More than brought a suit against Evans, which was decided in More's favour in Easter term.

Samwell claims there was a campaign of legal harassment masterminded by Francis Langley, whom Samwell describes as 'a barrator and common disturber of our majesty's subjects.'\r\n\r\nSamwell declares that Oliver and Susan Woodliffe had demised certain parts of the property, including the great yard and back yard, to Samwell for the term of eighteen years, excepting only access to certain rooms which the Woodliffes reserved for their own use, and the right for Woodliffe to build on the west part of the great yard. In July 1599 he agreed with the Woodliffes to rebuild 'divers rooms, galleries, chambers and other necessary buildings,' which he then erected.\r\n\r\nAround Michaelmas 1599, the Woodliffes and Langley conspired to deprive Samwell of his use of the galleries. In consequence, Samwell began proceedings against Oliver Woodliffe in the Court of the King's Bench, as well as against the Woodliffes, Langley and others in Chancery. Heedless of the impending suits, the Woodliffes shortly thereafter claimed rights in the Boar's Head galleries, and sold these to Francis Langley. \r\n\r\nSamwell accuses Langley of having entered the playhouse with a band of men equipped with various tools, who proceeded to cut down the galleries. On 24 December, Francis returned with Foxley, Johnson, Boulton, and Strayles and invaded the playhouse. Along with Roberts, Langley, Susan Woodliffe and others, they interrupted a play performance and pocketed the gallery takings, amounting to around \u00a34. Johnson and Foxley attempted to arrest Samwell and his son, Samwell's daughter-in-law Winifred and her infant, as well as a servant named Edward Willys.  They succeeded in arresting Winifred (and her infant), and later arrested Willys.\r\n\r\nAlexander Foxley and John Jonson, servants to Sir Thomas Gerrard, claimed on 16 December to have been authorized by the Marshal's Court and at the suit of Francis Langley and Oliver Woodliffe to arrest Samwell and his son. Samwell notes that the only action against his household at the time was a suit brought by a child, Richard Bishop, against Samwell's servant Edward Willy, which was \"tryable\"  by common law, and not in the Court of Marshalsea. Samwell counts a total of seven arrests of himself and his household in the Court of Marshalsea. Samwell's son, furthermore, had been bound to the peace in the King's Bench the previous Michaelmas. Langley, 'knowing the same, for vexation sake,' also had the younger Samwell bound to the peace in the Chancery Court. Langley and his compatriots, Samwell claims, gave out word that they would arrest Samwell if they needed money. The men affirmed, Samwell adds, that they made a practice of arresting people in the Court of Marshalsea, and made good money of it. Samwell complains that he himself has spent \u00a340 over the arrests. Langley conspired to have the marshals arrest Samwell's son on 4 April 1600, without warrant, and without bail. When Samwell's servant, Rowland Rosse, demanded to see the warrant, the marshals assaulted him, and beat and threatened to arrest Samwell the younger's wife, Winifred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n From: 11 April 1600\t From: 13 April 1598 To: 11 April 1600\t  company business court case playhouse business playhouse context Boar's Head  Richard Bishop Peter Boulton Alexander Foxley Sir Thomas Gerrard John Johnson Francis Langley Owen Roberts Rowland Rosse Richard, the Elder Samwell Mrs Winifred Samwell Anthony Strayles Edward Willys Susan Woodliffe Oliver Woodliffe ", [732, 733, 735, 737, 734, 736, 739, 730, 738, 775, 742, 772, 773, 774], [], [24]], [7303, "From: 10 May 1600", "From: 13 April 1598 To: 10 April 1600", "Star Chamber, Samwell vs Langley et al: The Woodliffes reply", "Star Chamber, Samwell vs Langley et al: The Woodliffes reply The Woodliffes reply to Richard Samwell's complaint.

The deposition provides information about the disagreement over ownership of the galleries in the inn, and of Langley's legal campaign against the Samwells.\r\n\r\nLangley says that the galleries were built in the great yard, which had not been demised by Woodliffe to Samwell, and therefore the galleries were in the possession of Woodliffe, who sold his interest in the inn to Langley by an indenture of 7 November 1599.\r\n\r\nLangley denies that he procured Anthony Strayles, Alexander Foxley, John Johnston, or Peter Boulton to invade the inn and assault Samwell and his son on 16 December, but that Strayles, Foxley, Johnston, and Boulton did enter the inn on that day to lawfully arrest Samwell at the suit of Oliver Woodliffe. Samwell submitted to arrest but was soon rescued by his son who, Langley heard, assaulted the marshal's men. No one to Langley's knowledge threw a dagger at the Samwells.\r\n\r\nLangley says that neither he nor any one in his company forcibly entered the inn armed on 23 or 24 December, but that on 24 December he did send Strayles to collect money from those in the galleries who came to see the play, amounting to about 5s.\r\n\r\nLangley denies that he or his agents collected money from the galleries on St. Stephen's Day (26 December), but that he and Strayles did attempt to collect gallery money that day, since the galleries stand upon his ground, but were prevented by Samwell the younger.  Owen Roberts cut down certain parts of the galleries by his command around Christmas, but only Langley and Roberts were present when this was done.\r\n\r\nLangley responds that around last Christmas Samwell the younger was arrested twice for trespass, once at the suit of Richard Bishop and once of Thomas Wolleston. Edward Willys, Samwell's servant, was also arrested for trespass around the same time at Bishop's suit. He denies that he procured Winifred Samwell's arrest, nor does he know anything of fees collected for the arrests.

Burbage had a new lease drawn up, which Allen pretended he would sign, but did not. Burbage notes that there was a great deal of contention between Allen and one Edmond Peckham over the title to the Theatre property.

Cuthbert argues that it was entirely within James Burbage's rights according to the terms of the lease to convert the barn into a tenement, and he went to great expense to do so and to maintain it over the years.

Burbage paid \u00a320 to procure the lease, and was to pay a quarterly rent of \u00a314, due at the four feasts of the year. The contract further stipulated that, within ten years of signing the lease, he was to have spent \u00a3200 of his own money on building and improving the property. If he should default on any of these terms, the Allens would have the legal right to re-enter the property. The lease gave Burbage full control over the land and its buildings, of which the summary provides a fairly detailed description.\r\n\r\nAllen admits that James Burbage asked him for a new lease, and gave him a draft of the lease. Contrary to Cuthbert Burbage's testimony, however, Allen did not agree to the terms of this lease as it differed in several points from the old. Moreover, James Burbage had been a troublesome tenant: litigious, behind in his rent, neglectful of the property, and inclined to fill the tenements with poor people who begged in the streets and thereby brought annoyance to the parish. Cuthbert Burbage perpetuates his father's legacy: both care only for their own 'commodity.' The tenements on the property are now in such disrepair that despite the \u00a3200 Burbage claims to have spent in improvements (but did not in fact, as Allen further adds), the buildings are in worse repair than they were when Burbage first took control of the property. For these reasons, Allen has refused to seal the new lease. Allen feels that he is entirely justified in bringing a suit against Burbage and his confederates, as Burbage had a right in the materials of the Theatre building only on the condition that he invested \u00a3200 in other buildings the property, which term has not been met. Allen concludes that the Burbage's profit of the property has far exceeded their investment, and that they have therefore been more than sufficiently recompensed for their expenditures.\r\n\r\nShortly before James Burbage's death, Allen was persuaded by the many entreaties of the Burbages to renew the lease on the Theatre property for another term of twenty-one years, at a yearly rent of \u00a324. Part of the agreement was that the Theatre should continue as a playhouse for only five years after the beginning of the contract, and thereafter be converted to some other use. James Burbage died before the terms of the new contract were drawn up, whereupon Cuthbert Burbage attempted to persuade Allen to draft the new lease according to the terms of the earlier. A new contracted was finally drafted, which Allen can present to the court, but Burbage has since by various means delayed the execution of the terms. Allen suspects that Cuthbert never intended to sign the new lease, but only bided his time until he could dismantle and move the Theatre, which Allen says Cuthbert did during the feast of the nativity 'in the fourtith yeare of her ma[ties] Raigne' (Christmas 1598).

He granted to Thomas Swinnerton, then a member of Queen Anne's company, an eighteenth share of the profits in the playhouse. He denies, however, as Woodford has claimed, that Swinnerton received 3d a day as a gatherer. If Swinnerton did received such an amount, it was not as part of his eighteenth share, but either as part of a special arrangment, or out of Woodford's own favour to Swinnerton. Swinnerton made an agreement with Philp Stone to sell his share in the Red Bull, but is not aware that Stone paid Swinnerton \u00a350 for this. He believes, rather, that Swinnerton recieved around \u00a325, paid in small sums. At the request of the two men, Holland transferred Swinnerton's share in the playhouse to Stone in an indenture dated 30 February 1609; the term of the contract was for 25 and three-quarter years. In return for his share in the playhouse, Stone was to pay Holland \u00a32 10s a year; were Stone to default on this payment, the contract would be void. Holland insists that the contract made no mention of a gatherer's place worth 3d a day. Stone and Woodford nevertheless collected this sum on a regular basis, on the pretence that the contract gave them the right to do so. When Holland demanded restitution of these sums, Stone refused and sold his share to Woodford. In his bill of complaint, Woodford claims that he sent an agent, Anthony Payne to pay the yearly rent of \u00a32 10s, but that Holland refused the sum; Holland denies this. Rather, Holland claims that he had no dealings whatsoever with Woodford over the playhouse, but that he continued to consider the share as Stone's. Having thus received no rent from Stone, Holland considered the contract void, and the share forfeit. He believes that he had good reason to forfeit the share, as the sum Stone had claimed as gatherer far exceeded the profits of an eighteenth share. Holland notes, furthermore, that he offered to restore the share on condition that Stone repay the sums he had wrongly claimed. At this point, however, Woodford brought his first suit against Holland, whereupon Holland reiterated his offer to restore the share upon return of the wrongfully gotten money. When the case finally went to arbitrament, Holland was awarded twenty marks as restitution for the sums Stone had wrongfully collected. Woodford, however, refused to pay the sum, and before Holland had a chance to take legal action against him, initiated another suit in the Court of Requests, which Holland countered with a writ of prohibition from the King's Bench. Woodford then tendered Holland an indenture drawn up according to Stone's former deed in the playhouse, which Holland put off sealing, hoping instead that the matter might be settled in arbitrament. The two parties subsequently bound themselves for \u00a320 to defer to the judgment of the arbiter. The arbiter decided as follows: 1. Holland was to make a new grant to Woodford for an eighteenth share in the playhouse; 2. Holland should enjoy the gatherer's place; 3. Holland should not be responsible for repaying any of the money collected on the share since its forfeiture; 4. Woodford should pay Holland \u00a32 in arrears rent; 5. all suits between the two parties should come to an end. Following the judgement, Holland assumed that all would be well; Woodford, however, refused shortly thereafter to pay his quarterly rent. At this point, Holland felt it necessary to put into action the writ of prohibition he had procured from the King's Bench; Woodford, predictably, fought against it. When Woodford's attempts here proved futile, he brought another suit against Holland in the Court of Requests, this time in Philip Stone's name. Holland then met with Stone, who willingly signed a document in which released his claim on the property in perpetuity. He denies having paid Stone for the document. Woodford then sued Holland in the Court of King's Bench, again in Stone's name, on a different matter. The expense of these several lawsuits has forced Holland to borrow substantially, and to sell his interest in the Red Bull property.

Swinnerton then sold his interest to Philip Stone for \u00a350 in February 1608. Stone was to pay Holland 50s a year for his share, and Holland could cancel the agreement for non-payment. Woodford purchased this share from Stone on 17 June 1612, and deputized his servant Anthony Payne to pay the rent and collect the profits during Woodford's absence from London.  Woodford accuses Holland of refusing to accept payment from Payne and then cancelling the agreement upon Woodford's return. \r\nWoodford then gives extensive details of the series of lawsuits he then initiated to retrieve his due profits. Woodford accuses Holland of continually refusing to follow the rulings of the Court of Requests (when in Woodford's favour), and of colluding with Philip Stone (by bribing him to release Holland from all claims in his name) to defraud Woodford of his due profits.

Barry claimed that the playhouse's apparel alone was worth \u00a3400, of which Androwes would own a sixth part, and suggested furthermore that Androwes would make a profit of \u00a3100 a year on the playhouse. Androwes entered into a contract with Barry and Slatier for a term of six years, eight months and twenty days, and paid \u00a370 for his share. He subsequently discovered that the apparel was worth not more than \u00a35. The charges of maintaining the playhouse and company, moreover, were exceedingly high; rather than make a profit, he lost around \u00a3300. The lease on the playhouse, moreover, was forfeited for non-payment of rent, and Androwes faced losing his investment. In order to maintain their hold on the playhouse, the various parties concerned [Lording Barry, Michael Drayton, William Trevell, William Cooke, Edward Sibthorpe, John Mason] bound themselves to Martin Slatier for \u00a3200 (the articles of their agreement, drafted 10 March 1607/8, are quoted in the bill of complaint).

Once the playhouse was shut down by royal command, any agreements between the two parties were effectively void, as Kirkham then backed away fom his obligations: 'the compl[ainan]t and this defend[an]t by his Ma[jes]ties speciall commaundement being prohibited to vse any plaies there, and some of the boyes being committed to prison by order from his highness, and so no proffitt made of the said howse but a contynuall rent of ffortie powndes to be paid for the same, that the same made the compl[ainan]t willing voluntarily to forgoe the same howse.'

Evans assigned half the lease and half the profits of the property to Kirkham and his associates in exchange for around 400l of work on the premises. \r\n\r\nKirkham and his associates then demised their share of the lease and profits to Evans' associate Alexander Hawkins, 'vpon the trust and confidence that he, the said Hawkins, his executors or assignes should, at all time and times, at the, at the request of your said oratour and the said Rastall and Kendall, or either of them should reassure the said leas and proffitts thereof to your said orator, Rastall and Kendall, or the suruivour of them accordinge to the foresaid agreem[en]t.'\r\n\r\nUpon Evans' request, Hawkins made over the profits of the lease in his trust to Mrs Evans, Henry Evans' wife and Hawkins' mother-in-law.

The original shareholders -- which included William Shakespeare, Augustine Phillips, Thomas Pope, John Heminges and William Kempe -- each possessed 'a fift parte of the said Moitie of the said gardens & groundes' of the Globe playhouse. After William Kempe's share was regranted and divided between Shakespeare, Phillips, Pope, and Heminges, the share in question increased to a 'fiveth parte and the fourth parte of another fiveth parte.' Heminges also stipulates that Augustine Phillips willed 'one third parte of all his goods & chattells to the said Anne,' but he does not know whether she elected to make the share of the Globe part of this third. He points out that the will of Augustine Phillips made Anne executrix under the condition that she not remarry after his death; if she did remarry,  John Heminges, Richard Burbage, and Timothy Whitehorn would become executors, 'as though the same Anne had never byn named.' If Anne had assigned the share to Witter after marriage, Heminges maintains that it 'was and is meerely void in Lawe.'\r\n\r\nHeminges also provides an account of how the sharers resolved to rebuild the Globe after its destruction by taxing each share. Witter did not respond to requests for his contribution, and Heminges eventually took possession of his share as a result. Because the expense of re-building the playhouse was to be large, and because he he doubted that Witter would benefit from the new playhouse, as the lease was soon to expire, he transferred a moiety of Witter's original share to Henry Condell. The re-edification of the playhouse, he notes, has since cost Heminges and Condell approximately \u00a3120.\r\n\r\nHeminges also denies that he or any other sharer is in possession of any assignment of the share between Anne Phillips and the plaintiff, but maintains that he has a copy of Augustine Phillips' will and the original deed to the share. He also maintains that upon repayment of the 50l mortgage of the deed, Anne Phillips urged him to retain the deed to the share because 'deluerye thereof vnto the said Complainant would be her vtter vndoing.' The answer concludes by noting that Heminges has 'divers & manie times in Charitie & to relieve' given a 'greate some of money' to Witter, Anne Phillips and her children, and that any notion that the defendants have attempted to defraud them is 'falsely & slaunderously suggested.'

Some eighteenth months before he signed the contract of July 1635, Richard Gunnell and the plaintiffs enticed him away from the Red Bull with promises of bountiful rewards. He thereupon made a number of successful plays for them, among which the Sparagus Garden brought them upwards of \u00a31,000. Recognizing how useful Brome would be to them, the complainants then persuaded him to sign a three-year contract, which at first he was unwilling to take on 'as being more than he could well perform.' The complainants assured him, however, that while the contract stipulated three plays over three years, they did not expect him to produce more than was reasonable or convenient. Their purpose in stipulating such a number of plays was 'only to oblige this defendant to dedicate all his labour and plays totally unto their sole profits'. \r\nBrome signed the contract with the intention of living up to its terms, providing that they expect no more from him than he could reasonably produce. Brome delivered two new plays to them within three-quarters of a year of signing the contract; the second play being performed around the time the plague was taking hold of London, he did not receive the clear day's profit for it, at a personal loss of more than \u00a35. He intended to use the time during which the theatre was closed to work on new plays, and assumed that he would continue to be paid his weekly salary over this period. The complainants, however, were reluctant to pay him, and around May 1636 offered to cancel the contract, which put Brome and his family to hardship 'in that hard, sad and dangerous time of the sickness'. Brome was finally pressed to borrow \u00a36 of William Beeston, who lent the sum on condition that he write a new play for Beeston's company. The complainants then urged Brome to abandon Beeston, and to return to them. He was finally persuaded, and agreed to accept \u00a310 in lieu of his weekly salary; this amount was not delivered to him until he had written a new play for them, and then only in small amounts. \r\nWhen the plague continued, Brome was forced again to turn to Beeston, whereupon the complainants brought a suit before the Master of Revels, who awarded Brome 6s. weekly and \u00a35 for every new play. The complainants paid only part of this, and when the theatre re-opened in October 1637 they were indebted \u00a311 11s 6d to the defendant. Since then, up to Easter term 1639, Brome has supplied the company with a total of eight new plays, the last 'written all but part of the last scene'. The company having abused and slighted his work, however, Brome has since entered into a contract with Beeston. Brome remarks furthermore that he was very sick while still in the company's employ; when he asked them for help, they refused and sent word that they would employ him no longer, and thereby defaulted on the contract. He notes that he owes them only two plays, and that he has done more than sufficient work in revising old plays and writing epilogues and prologues, songs, and introductions to make up the difference. Brome concedes that he has, out of necessity, sold a new play to Beeston, but that the complainants have also had it, and made more than \u00a31,000 from it. He did agree on a weekly salary of 20s., but did not sign the contract, and denies either that he received any payment in this amount, or that he is in arrears to the complainants.

The complainants charge that at this point Brome was in arrears four plays; moreover, he had sold one of his plays to Christopher Beeston. This aside, Brome's contract was renewed for a term of seven years in August 1638, under which he agreed to supply the plays in arrears, and to produce three new plays a year for the company, this time at a weekly salary of 20s., nor was he to write for any other company. The contract further stipulated that half Brome's salary be held back should he fail to deliver. The contract also made provisions for the four plays owing. Brome accepted the terms of the contract and, having been paid his new salary, the complainants expected that he would fulfill the terms of his agreement. Instead, they charge, he has failed to deliver the plays in arrears and has since wholly given himself over to Beeston and the Ph\u0153nix. Notwithstanding the payment he has received from them, furthermore, he refuses to deliver the plays in arrears, or to make satisfaction for the salary tendered, at a loss to the complainants of at least \u00a3500.

As Berry explains, Trevell was indebted to Woodford over bonds he had entered into in August 1607 toward a share in the playhouse. Woodford got money from Trevell in 1611 and 1621, and then tried again in 1640, whereupon Trevell sued Woodford in the Court of Requests. Trevell died soon after the case was brought to court, but his widow successfully continued the suit. The court decided in Trevell's favour on 11 June 1642. The court's decree provides an account of the events surrounding Trevell and Woodford's original agreement. Trevell was bound to Woodford for the sums of \u00a340 and \u00a320 over a sixth part of the lease on the Whitefriars. He was persuaded to invest in the playhouse by Sir Anthony Ashley, a Mr Smith, and Woodford himself; these three also convinced Trevell to bind himself for various other sums 'only to make a stock for supply of the playhouse.' Ashley then conspired with Woodford to have the players turned out and the lease declared forfeit, on the pretense of non-payment of rent, by which means Trevell lost the benefit of his investment.
