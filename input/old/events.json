        "Star Chamber, Allen vs the Burbages et al: Giles Allen states his case Giles Allen continues his series of suits against the Burbages with one in the Star Chamber against Cuthbert. \r\n\r\nIn his bill of complaint Allen recites the details of his twenty-one year lease to James Burbage, including that the permission to build the Theatre and to extend the lease were contingent upon the expenditure of \u00a3200 for other improvements to the property. Allen argues he was not bound to extend the lease because the Theatre was financed by John Brayne, the lease assigned to John Hyde, and Burbage still owed him \u00a330 in rent. Allen charges that Cuthbert Burbage and his confederates assembled around 28 December 1598, armed with various weapons, and attempted to pull down the Theatre building. They resisted the attempts of Allen's servants and tenants to stop them. Once they had torn down the building, they carried the remains over the Bankside and erected a new theatre there.  \r\n\r\nAllen then summarizes the various suits that have passed between Cuthbert and himself, and explains his arrest for contempt of court as the result of a conspiracy by Cuthbert, his attorney and Richard Lane, registrar for the Court of Request. He claims that Cuthbert and Richard Burbage so threatened and intimidated his witnesses (threatening to stab them) that they were afraid to tell the truth on Allen's behalf. Richard Hudson and Thomas Osborne, carpenters, perjured themselves in testifying that James Burbage had spent \u00a3240 in repairs and building on the Theatre property. Allen says evidence from the Chancery court will attest that Richard Hudson did not survey the property in 1586, nor had James Burbage spent anywhere near \u00a3240 on the property by 18 July 1586. Cuthbert won his suit by means of such dishonesties, according to Allen.

Farrant claimed to use the house only to teach the children, but in fact used it as a playhouse, to the detriment of  both the neighbourhood and the house itself. Farrant also breached the contract in letting part of the house. After Farrant's death, More took possession of the house and accepted rent only conditionally. After refusing to go to court against More over the lease, Anne Farrant sublet the property to William Hunnis, and then Newman or Sutton (he does not remember which), then to Henry Evans, who sold his interest to the Earl of Oxford, who gave his to John Lyly. More than brought a suit against Evans, which was decided in More's favour in Easter term.

        "Star Chamber, Samwell vs Langley et al: Samwell interrogates Langley and Roberts Richard Samwell interrogates Francis Langley and Owen Roberts concerning the series of playhouse invasions orchestrated by Langley, and about Langley's campaign to harass his family by a series of arrests. \r\n\r\nSamwell asks Francis Langley a series of questions concerning Langley's rights in the galleries: if the rights were purchased from the Woodliffes, whether the Woodliffes indeed owned the galleries, and who built the galleries. Samwell refers to the expenses he incurred erecting the galleries in midsummer 1599.  \r\n\r\nSamwell declares that Langley, along with Susan Woodliffe, Owen Roberts, Alexander Foxley, John Johnson, Peter Boulton, and Anthony Strayles, all armed, attempted to enter and take possession of the premises on 13 December 1599. Failing this attempt, the armed assembly returned on 16 December and assaulted Samwell, and his son with intent to murder them.  Samwell questions Langley about these facts, and asks Langley whether he procured and directed the men who invaded the playhouse on 16 December, and whether and by whom a dagger was thrown at Samwell and his son. \r\n\r\nSamwell asks Langley whether he, with Susan Woodliffe, Owen Roberts, Anthony Strayles, and others, entered the premises on the 23rd or 24th of December, and whether, how much, and by what right they gathered money there. Samwell asks Langley and Roberts whether and why they took money from the galleries on 26 December, whether Owen Roberts broke open the walls of the galleries to make a new door, and whether Langley, Strayles and Susan Woodliffe were present when Roberts did so. \r\n\r\nSamwell asks Langley a series of questions concerning whether, for what reason, and by what authority he orchestrated the arrests of his son, his son's wife Winifred, and Samwell's servant Edward Willys. He asks how often Langley has had members of his household arrested, and how much money this has cost Samwell. He asks Langley whether he procured the arrest of his daughter-in-law Winifred by Foxley, Johnson, and Boulton.\r\n\r\nSamwell further questions Langley about his actions against the Samwell household in the Court of Marshalsea, and more particularly about Richard Bishop's suit against Edward Willys. Samwell asks Langley whether there have been six actions brought against the Samwell household in the Court of Marshalsea at the suits variously of Langley, Bishop, Woodliffe and Johnson and whether, furthermore, Langley was not behind all of these. \r\n\r\nHe asks whether Langley purposely initiated the suits in order to vex the family, whether he had Samwell the younger arrested in the King's Bench, and what precisely the cause of Thomas Wolleston's suit against Samwell the younger was. \r\n\r\n\r\n From: 22 April 1600\t From: 24 June 1599 To: 22 April 1600\t  court case performance playhouse business playhouse context Boar's Head  Peter Boulton Alexander Foxley John Johnson Francis Langley Owen Roberts Richard, the Elder Samwell Richard, the Younger Samwell Anthony Strayles Edward Willys Thomas Wolleston Oliver Woodliffe Susan Woodliffe ",

        "Star Chamber, Samwell vs Langley et al: Richard Samwell the Elder states his case Richard Samwell's bill of complaint in his suit against Francis Langley and others provides details of his original lease and the subsequent dispute over the Boar's Head galleries. Samwell claims there was a campaign of legal harassment masterminded by Francis Langley, whom Samwell describes as 'a barrator and common disturber of our majesty's subjects.'\r\n\r\nSamwell declares that Oliver and Susan Woodliffe had demised certain parts of the property, including the great yard and back yard, to Samwell for the term of eighteen years, excepting only access to certain rooms which the Woodliffes reserved for their own use, and the right for Woodliffe to build on the west part of the great yard. In July 1599 he agreed with the Woodliffes to rebuild 'divers rooms, galleries, chambers and other necessary buildings,' which he then erected.\r\n\r\nAround Michaelmas 1599, the Woodliffes and Langley conspired to deprive Samwell of his use of the galleries. In consequence, Samwell began proceedings against Oliver Woodliffe in the Court of the King's Bench, as well as against the Woodliffes, Langley and others in Chancery. Heedless of the impending suits, the Woodliffes shortly thereafter claimed rights in the Boar's Head galleries, and sold these to Francis Langley. \r\n\r\nSamwell accuses Langley of having entered the playhouse with a band of men equipped with various tools, who proceeded to cut down the galleries. On 24 December, Francis returned with Foxley, Johnson, Boulton, and Strayles and invaded the playhouse. Along with Roberts, Langley, Susan Woodliffe and others, they interrupted a play performance and pocketed the gallery takings, amounting to around \u00a34. Johnson and Foxley attempted to arrest Samwell and his son, Samwell's daughter-in-law Winifred and her infant, as well as a servant named Edward Willys.  They succeeded in arresting Winifred (and her infant), and later arrested Willys.\r\n\r\nAlexander Foxley and John Jonson, servants to Sir Thomas Gerrard, claimed on 16 December to have been authorized by the Marshal's Court and at the suit of Francis Langley and Oliver Woodliffe to arrest Samwell and his son. Samwell notes that the only action against his household at the time was a suit brought by a child, Richard Bishop, against Samwell's servant Edward Willy, which was \"tryable\"  by common law, and not in the Court of Marshalsea. Samwell counts a total of seven arrests of himself and his household in the Court of Marshalsea. Samwell's son, furthermore, had been bound to the peace in the King's Bench the previous Michaelmas. Langley, 'knowing the same, for vexation sake,' also had the younger Samwell bound to the peace in the Chancery Court. Langley and his compatriots, Samwell claims, gave out word that they would arrest Samwell if they needed money. The men affirmed, Samwell adds, that they made a practice of arresting people in the Court of Marshalsea, and made good money of it. Samwell complains that he himself has spent \u00a340 over the arrests. Langley conspired to have the marshals arrest Samwell's son on 4 April 1600, without warrant, and without bail. When Samwell's servant, Rowland Rosse, demanded to see the warrant, the marshals assaulted him, and beat and threatened to arrest Samwell the younger's wife, Winifred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n From: 11 April 1600\t From: 13 April 1598 To: 11 April 1600\t  company business court case playhouse business playhouse context Boar's Head  Richard Bishop Peter Boulton Alexander Foxley Sir Thomas Gerrard John Johnson Francis Langley Owen Roberts Rowland Rosse Richard, the Elder Samwell Mrs Winifred Samwell Anthony Strayles Edward Willys Susan Woodliffe Oliver Woodliffe ",

The rioters 'played theyr parts, in divers places, as Finsburie feilds, about Wapping by St. Katherines, and in Lincolns Ynne fields, in which places beeing assembled in great numbers they fell to great disorders in pulling downe of houses and beating the guards that were set to kepe rule, specially at a new play house (sometime a cockpit) in Drurie Lane, where the Quenes players used to play.'\r\nHaving attacked the guards, slain three, and wounded many others, the apprentices 'entered the [play]house and defaced yt, cutting the players apparell all in pieces, and all other theyre furniture and burnt theyre play bookes and did what other mischeife they could.'\r\n\r\nThe apprentices also freed prisoners from the prison in Finsbury and pulled down many houses in Wapping. Chamberlain speculates that some rioters will be hanged next week.\r\n\r\nJust before the report of the riot, Chamberlain mentions that the 'The Kings journy into Scotland holds on this day sevenight though monie come slowly in.' \r\n\r\nOn the day of the riot, the Queen's residence Somerset House was renamed Denmark House.

The price of the tickets was '2s or 18d at least'. Once Fennor had collected most of the money, he tried to escape, but having chosen to go by water rather than horseback, was caught and brought before the Chief Justice.

        " The court judges in William Trevell's lawsuit against Thomas Woodford. As Berry explains, Trevell was indebted to Woodford over bonds he had entered into in August 1607 toward a share in the playhouse. Woodford got money from Trevell in 1611 and 1621, and then tried again in 1640, whereupon Trevell sued Woodford in the Court of Requests. Trevell died soon after the case was brought to court, but his widow successfully continued the suit. The court decided in Trevell's favour on 11 June 1642. The court's decree provides an account of the events surrounding Trevell and Woodford's original agreement. Trevell was bound to Woodford for the sums of \u00a340 and \u00a320 over a sixth part of the lease on the Whitefriars. He was persuaded to invest in the playhouse by Sir Anthony Ashley, a Mr Smith, and Woodhouse himself; these three also convinced Trevell to bind himself for various other sums 'only to make a stock for supply of the playhouse.' Ashley then conspired with Woodhouse to have the players turned out and the lease declared forfeit, on the pretense of non-payment of rent, by which means Trevell lost the benefit of his investment.

        "Requests, Salisbury Court vs Brome: Richard Brome responds to the charges Richard Brome responds to the charges of the owners and company of Salisbury Court. Some eighteenth months before he signed the contract of July 1635, Richard Gunnell and the plaintiffs enticed him away from the Red Bull with promises of bountiful rewards. He thereupon made a number of successful plays for them, among which the Sparagus Garden brought them upwards of \u00a31,000. Recognizing how useful Brome would be to them, the complainants then persuaded him to sign a three-year contract, which at first he was unwilling to take on 'as being more than he could well perform.' The complainants assured him, however, that while the contract stipulated three plays over three years, they did not expect him to produce more than was reasonable or convenient. Their purpose in stipulating such a number of plays was 'only to oblige this defendant to dedicate all his labour and plays totally unto their sole profits'. \r\nBrome signed the contract with the intention of living up to its terms, providing that they expect no more from him than he could reasonably produce. Brome delivered two new plays to them within three-quarters of a year of signing the contract; the second play being performed around the time the plague was taking hold of London, he did not receive the clear day's profit for it, at a personal loss of more than \u00a35. He intended to use the time during which the theatre was closed to work on new plays, and assumed that he would continue to be paid his weekly salary over this period. The complainants, however, were reluctant to pay him, and around May 1636 offered to cancel the contract, which put Brome and his family to hardship 'in that hard, sad and dangerous time of the sickness'. Brome was finally pressed to borrow \u00a36 of William Beeston, who lent the sum on condition that he write a new play for Beeston's company. The complainants then urged Brome to abandon Beeston, and to return to them. He was finally persuaded, and agreed to accept \u00a310 in lieu of his weekly salary; this amount was not delivered to him until he had written a new play for them, and then only in small amounts. \r\nWhen the plague continued, Brome was forced again to turn to Beeston, whereupon the complainants brought a suit before the Master of Revels, who awarded Brome 6s. weekly and \u00a35 for every new play. The complainants paid only part of this, and when the theatre re-opened in October 1637 they were indebted \u00a311 11s 6d to the defendant. Since then, up to Easter term 1639, Brome has supplied the company with a total of eight new plays, the last 'written all but part of the last scene'. The company having abused and slighted his work, however, Brome has since entered into a contract with Beeston. Brome remarks furthermore that he was very sick while still in the company's employ; when he asked them for help, they refused and sent word that they would employ him no longer, and thereby defaulted on the contract. He notes that he owes them only two plays, and that he has done more than sufficient work in revising old plays and writing epilogues and prologues, songs, and introductions to make up the difference. Brome concedes that he has, out of necessity, sold a new play to Beeston, but that the complainants have also had it, and made more than \u00a31,000 from it. He did agree on a weekly salary of 20s., but did not sign the contract, and denies either that he received any payment in this amount, or that he is in arrears to the complainants.

        "Requests, Salisbury Court vs Brome: The owners and players state their case Richard Brome is charged by the owners and players of Salisbury Court with having failed to meet his obligations as a playwright. On 20 July 1635, Brome signed a three-year contract with the company, under the terms of which he was obligated to supply them with three plays a year, at a wage of 15s. a week, as well as the benefit of one day's profit, less the ordinary charges of the house. Brome was not to sell plays to any other house during this period. \r\nThe contract was interrupted when the plague closed the playhouse, during which time Brome accepted a sum of \u00a310 in lieu of his weekly salary; this agreement was signed 26 October 1636. At the end of the three-year term, the owners paid Brome his full salary for the whole period, less only \u00a35. The complainants charge that at this point Brome was in arrears four plays; moreover, he had sold one of his plays to Christopher Beeston. This aside, Brome's contract was renewed for a term of seven years in August 1638, under which he agreed to supply the plays in arrears, and to produce three new plays a year for the company, this time at a weekly salary of 20s., nor was he to write for any other company. The contract further stipulated that half Brome's salary be held back should he fail to deliver. The contract also made provisions for the four plays owing. Brome accepted the terms of the contract and, having been paid his new salary, the complainants expected that he would fulfill the terms of his agreement. Instead, they charge, he has failed to deliver the plays in arrears and has since wholly given himself over to Beeston and the Ph\u0153nix. Notwithstanding the payment he has received from them, furthermore, he refuses to deliver the plays in arrears, or to make satisfaction for the salary tendered, at a loss to the complainants of at least \u00a3500.

Goburne agrees with Allen's characterization of James Burbage as a bad tenant behind in his rent and property improvements. He affirms that \u00a330 rent is still owed by the Burbages, and that James never made the full \u00a3200 improvements he promised, only a part thereof. He says that James kept the property in good repair for the first ten years of the lease, but thereafter and especially after his death the property has decayed greatly. Goburne says he was present when Cuthbert and Allen agreed to extend the lease provided the rent in arrears was paid, rent was increased, and the Theatre would cease being used as a playhouse in five years. The negotiations broke down when Richard Burbage was offered as a surety, and the Theatre pulled down the following Christmas. Goburne heard that the Theatre building was being pulled down and, having a letter of attorney from Allen forbidding this, went to the site to prevent it. He noted that the people in charge were Thomas Smythe, Cuthbert Burbage, and Peter Street. The remaining involved were paid labourers, whose names he does not recall.\r\nGoburne affirms that James Burbage was a good landlord, since he was one of his tenants.

        "Requests, Cuthbert Burbage vs Allen: Henry Johnson deposes Henry Johnson deposes in Cuthbert Burbage's suit against Giles Allen in Requests court. Johnson affirms that James Burbage drew up a new lease but that Allen refused to sign it for the reasons enumerated in the interrogatories. He affirms there was a bond of \u00a3200 between James Burbage and Allen, and that Burbage owed \u00a330 in rent at the time of his death. Johnson is not of the opinion that James Burbage spent at least \u00a3200 improving the properties during the first ten years of the lease. Johnson affirms that he was present during the negotiations between Cuthbert Burbage and Allen for the renewal of the lease, and gives details of the negotiations and disagreements similar to those in the interrogatories and other depositions, including the agreement that the Theatre would remain a playhouse for only five more years. Johnson reports as hearsay that Ellen Burbage is poor and that John Brayne financed half the Theatre. Johnson reports that he was a tenant of James Burbage, who was a good landlord, but that Burbage was often behind in his rent to Allen. \r\n\r\n  Johnson says he went to the Theatre while Burbage and the workmen were pulling down the building and ordered them to stop, as they had no permission or agreement to do so. He noted that the persons involved were Cuthbert and Richard Burbage, Thomas Smyth, and Peter Street. They informed him that they were pulling the building down only to set it up on the same premises in another form, and showed him the defects in the building as it presently stood.

Johnson says that Cuthbert admitted that \u00a330 in rent was due upon James Burbage's death, and that Cuthbert agreed to pay it if Allen extended the lease, but that the Theatre would be used as a playhouse for only five more years.  Allen, however, would not extend the lease until the arrears were paid. Johnson adds that he believes Allen delayed making a new lease in order to drive up the annual rent. Johnson notes that he has on several occasions witnessed Burbage ask Allen to draw up a new lease, and that it is three years since he first heard Burbage do so. Allen was at the George, where he stayed when in London to collect his rents, when Burbage asked him for a new lease.

Cuthbert does say that James was often troubled by Edmond Peckham over the title of the properties in question so that he could not always enjoy his full right to the property according to the lease. Cuthbert argues that it was entirely within James Burbage's rights according to the terms of the lease to convert the barn into a tenement, and he went to great expense to do so, and to maintain it over the years. Burbage denies that the tenants are beggars and make trouble in the parish, and that James Burbage cared more for profit than reputation. He denies that he has failed to repair the tenements since his father's death and that affirms that James Burbage spent the stipulated \u00a3200 on building and reparations. Cuthbert blames Allen's unreasonable demands for the failure to renew the lease, which James greatly desired. He admits that he pulled down the Theatre building, and attests that he did so lawfully according to the terms of the original lease.

        "Requests, Cuthbert Burbage vs Allen: Giles Allen replies Giles Allen responds to Cuthbert Burbage's countersuit in the Court of Requests. Allen's statement provides details of his original lease to James Burbage the land the Theatre was built on, as well as the subsequent failed negotiations to extend that lease.\r\n\r\nThe term of the original lease, signed 13 April 1576, began 25 March 1576 and was to last for a period of twenty-one years, to be renewed after ten years if Burbage executed the conditions of the agreement. Burbage paid \u00a320 to procure the lease, and was to pay a quarterly rent of \u00a314, due at the four feasts of the year. The contract further stipulated that, within ten years of signing the lease, he was to have spent \u00a3200 of his own money on building and improving the property. If he should default on any of these terms, the Allens would have the legal right to re-enter the property. The lease gave Burbage full control over the land and its buildings, of which the summary provides a fairly detailed description.\r\n\r\nAllen admits that James Burbage asked him for a new lease, and gave him a draft of the lease. Contrary to Cuthbert Burbage's testimony, however, Allen did not agree to the terms of this lease as it differed in several points from the old. Moreover, James Burbage had been a troublesome tenant: litigious, behind in his rent, neglectful of the property, and inclined to fill the tenements with poor people who begged in the streets and thereby brought annoyance to the parish. Cuthbert Burbage perpetuates his father's legacy: both care only for their own 'commodity.' The tenements on the property are now in such disrepair that despite the \u00a3200 Burbage claims to have spent in improvements (but did not in fact, as Allen further adds), the buildings are in worse repair than they were when Burbage first took control of the property. For these reasons, Allen has refused to seal the new lease. Allen feels that he is entirely justified in bringing a suit against Burbage and his confederates, as Burbage had a right in the materials of the Theatre building only on the condition that he invested \u00a3200 in other buildings the property, which term has not been met. Allen concludes that the Burbage's profit of the property has far exceeded their investment, and that they have therefore been more than sufficiently recompensed for their expenditures.\r\n\r\nShortly before James Burbage's death, Allen was persuaded by the many entreaties of the Burbages to renew the lease on the Theatre property for another term of twenty-one years, at a yearly rent of \u00a324. Part of the agreement was that the Theatre should continue as a playhouse for only five years after the beginning of the contract, and thereafter be converted to some other use. James Burbage died before the terms of the new contract were drawn up, whereupon Cuthbert Burbage attempted to persuade Allen to draft the new lease according to the terms of the earlier. A new contracted was finally drafted, which Allen can present to the court, but Burbage has since by various means delayed the execution of the terms. Allen suspects that Cuthbert never intended to sign the new lease, but only bided his time until he could dismantle and move the Theatre, which Allen says Cuthbert did during the feast of the nativity 'in the fourtith yeare of her ma[ties] Raigne' (Christmas 1598).  \r\n\r\n From: 4 February 1600\t From: 25 March 1576 To: 4 February 1600\t  court case playhouse business Theatre  Giles Allen Sara Allen Richard Brackenbury John Brayne James Burbage Ellen Burbage Cuthbert Burbage Chiborne Ewan Colfoxe Thomas Dancaster Alice Dotridge John Dragon William Garnett Joan Harrison Robert Miles Hugh Richardes Robert Stoughton ",

        "Requests, Cuthbert Burbage vs Allen: Cuthbert Burbage states his case Cuthbert Burbage brings a countersuit against Giles Allen in the court of Requests over the dismantling of the Theatre. Burbage charges that Allen is using the non-renewal of the lease to bring an action of trespass against him. According to the terms of the earlier lease, the Burbages had the right to carry away any part of the Theatre building before the term of the lease had expired; Burbage implies here that he was following the terms of the lease on the assumption that Allen was sincere in his promise to renew. Allen is now trying to claim the value of the Theatre building in recompense, the burden of which expense, if Allen should prove successful, will fall on Burbage. Arguing that Allen was in conscience still bound to the terms of the original lease, Burbage asks that the case be tried as a matter of equity. Burbage states that upon several occasions he requested Allen to draft a new lease, and that Allen promised he would do so, but continually deferred the process. Since the original twenty-one year term expired, Allen has suffered Burbage to remain on the premises, and accepted rent from him. Cuthbert Burbage suggests that this may be one reason why his father held back a portion of the rent. Upon several occasions towards the end of the ten-year period, he claims, James Burbage spoke to Giles Allen about renewing the lease. Burbage had a new lease drawn up, which Allen pretended he would sign, but did not. Burbage notes that there was a great deal of contention between Allen and one Edmond Peckham over the title to the Theatre property. The controversy prevented James Burbage from enjoying fully the terms of the lease; moreover, he was often forced to employ men to prevent Peckham from seizing the premises.

Taking into account the consortium's intention to spend \u00a31000 in rebuilding the playhouse, in consideration, furthermore, of the damage and loss suffered by the players, and on the promise of \u00a310 to be paid to him once he reached seniority, Brend promised to extend the original thirty-one year lease on the playhouse by fifteen years. The same conditions that obtained under the old contract were to apply to the extended lease.  Globe (II)   ",

        "undefined As Berry explains, John Witter had married Anne Phillips soon after the death of her first husband, Augustine Phillips, an actor in the King's Men company. When Anne died, Witter brought John Heminges and Henry Condell to court over Anne's shares in the Globe playhouse. In his bill of complaint, Witter explains that at one point he been forced to mortgage his interest in the playhouse to John Heminges for the sum of \u00a350, which he subsequently repaid in full, with interest. Recently, however, Heminges and Condell have managed to acquire the original documents relating to Phillips' share in the property, and have since taken possession of the share and deprived Phillips' heirs of the profits arising from it.

        "undefined John Heminges and Henry Condell respond to John Witter's bill of complaint. They attest that Augustine Phillips had during his lifetime a fifth share in the Globe playhouse, and that at the time of his death, Phillips made his wife Anne the executrix of his property. They note, however, that this appointment was not absolute, and that, should Anne remarry, the executorship of the property would revert to John Heminges, Richard Burbage, William Sly and Timothy Whithorne. They relate the circumstances under which Witter applied to them for a loan, and agree that he repaid the \u00a350 debt in full. Because Anne had remarried, however, she lost her right as executrix; Heminges assumed control of Phillips' property legally and with Anne's knowledge and consent. The action was necessary, he notes, to prevent Witter from squandering the inheritance. Heminges testifies, furthermore, that he has upon several occasions disbursed sums of money to Phillips' widow and her children, and that he paid for her burial expenses.  Globe (II)   ",

Shortly after the fire, Heminges and his partners resolved to re-build the playhouse. They contacted Witter about his contribution to the re-edification as a sharer in the house; Witter, however, failed to respond to their request. Heminges thereupon took possession of Witter's share. Because the expense of re-building the playhouse was to be large, and because he he doubted that Witter would benefit from the new playhouse, as the lease was soon to expire, he transferred a moiety of Witter's original share to Henry Condell.

The statement quotes extensively from the original lease on the Globe property.\r\n\r\nAccording to the terms of the lease, Nicholas Brend grants the Globe consortium the legal right to make any changes to buildings on the Globe property, 'so as there be as good or better re-edified and built on the premises within a year then next ensuing.' The lessees agree on their part to keep the property in good repair, and to leave all edifices and buildings as they stand, 'or others as good and convenient for the place,' at the expiration of the leases.\r\n\r\nThe plaintiffs contend that after leasing the property, they spent a further \u00a3700 in building the playhouse. After 'being burnt down by Casualtie of fier' within the original term, the players spent an additional \u00a31000 to rebuild the playhouse with the understanding that the investment would entail an extension of the lease term. Brend was fourteen at the time of the signing of the extension agreement that would come into effect when he came of age, also endorsed by his mother and uncle. \r\n\r\nSir John Bodley also held an interest in the property, and out of consideration for the 'said losse by fire and charge of new building' moved to extend the lease by six years from the end of the original lease of 'one and thirty yeeres'.

According to Smith, he delivered a series of parcels from 27 June 1612 to 23 February 1617. The amount in question was \u00a346 5s 8d, 'or thereabouts.' Smith says that Beeston, Ellis Worth, Richard Perkins, and John Cumber have seen and approved his account book and that Beeston has promised payment, but since then have combined to refuse payment. In addition, the players have enticed Smith's servant Thomas Chambers to leave his service and go 'into some vknowne & remote place' because Chambers was the only witness to the delivery of stuff.

Unwilling as Cooke was to lend the money, he finally agreed to convince his friend Jobber to disburse the sum. On 16 October 1607, Cooke met Trevell and others [Lording Barry, Edward Sibthorpe, John Mason, John Cooke] at a London shop, ready to exchange the \u00a320 for a bond which conferred upon Jobber two twelfths of the Whitefriars lease, as well as part of the shares. The company, however, refused to accept the whole sum, and demanded instead a few smaller amounts to pay for various expenses at the playhouse [\u00a32 3s to Mason, \u00a33 to Sibthorpe for a week's food and board for the boy company, \u00a33 in advance for their own food]. They asked Cooke to hold on to the rest until such time as they should require it. Cooke duly made a series of payments, amounting to \u00a320, which he claims came from his own coffers, and not Jobber's. Cooke further deposes that he owned a half share in the Whitefriars, which cost him \u00a345, and which he has since lost.  Whitefriars   ",

        " William Trevell sues William Cooke and others in the Court of Requests. In his reply to Trevell's charge, Cooke refers to financial difficulties involving the playhouse in the autumn of 1607. Cooke claims that he was persuaded by Trevell and others to disburse \u00a345 towards expenses for the playhouse, and was promised that he would receive great rewards in return. This money has not been returned to him, and he has never benefited from it. Rather, he was persuaded to lend Trevell a further 20 nobles [Berry notes: \u00a36 13 s 4d], for which Trevell bound himself to a man named Jobber. Cooke lent Trevell a further \u00a320, for which Trevell was also bound to Jobber; shortly thereafter, Trevell declared himself insolvent. In 1607, Cooke had Trevell arrested on Jobber's behalf, whereupon Trevell was ordered by Guidhall to repay the debt. Trevell, however, continues to be delinquent in his payments, and still owes 17s 8d, based on the Guildhall ruling.  Whitefriars   ",

Once the theatres had re-opened, they returned to the Swan and offered to resume playing, if Langley would 'bear them out.' Langley refused to do so, but told them they could do what they wished with the playhouse. When they expressed an unwillingness to play without license, and noted that Philip Henslowe had obtained a license for his playhouse, Langley suggested they move to the Rose. They assumed that Langley meant well by this, but now realize that he was scheming to disenfranchise them. They deny that Langley spent upwards of \u00a3300 on the playhouse, which was already fitted for performing, and note that Langley's investment in costumes was part of their original agreement. They contend, furthermore, that the playhouse was unprofitable until they began playing there, and enumerate the various ways in which Langley has benefitted from their occupancy, particularly in the money he has earned from renting out their apparel. Langley refuses to return the apparel, will not accept their offers to reimburse him for what he may have spent on it. They ask that the court take measures to have the apparel returned to them.

        "Requests, Savage vs Hicks and Honingborne: Jerome Savage states his case Jerome Savage, an actor with the Warwick's Men, sues Richard Hickes and Peter Hunningborne over their failure to honour his lease on the Newington Butts property. His bill of complaint provides details of the Newington lease and property. \r\n\r\nSavage claims that Hicks and Honingborne have conspired by underhanded means to deprive him of the property. His interest in the property, he explains, derives from Richard Thompson, who originally held a nineteen-year lease on the property. On 25 March 1576, Hicks granted Savage's request for a thirty-year lease on the property, for the sum of \u00a310 and a yearly rent of four marks, due quarterly at four terms. A proviso in the lease granted Hicks the right to repossess the property 'if the said rent or any part thereof were behind in part or in all at any feast or day aforesaid wherein the said rent ought to be paid and by fourteen days after, being lawfully demanded.' Hicks, in the interest of repossessing the property for his son-in-law, now claims that Honingborne has a right in the property based on a grant ante-dating Savage's lease. Fearing, however, that this factitious lease may not be sufficient to defeat Savage's claim, Hicks and Honingborne have devised a further plot to dispossess Savage, as follows. At the feast of the annunciation, Savage left his quarterly rent in the charge of Thomas Whaston, with the order to pay the sum to Hicks when called upon. Aware of Savage's absence, Hicks deliberately avoided the house for the first thirteen days of the pay-period; Honingborne visited on the fourteenth day, when he knew that Whaston had gone to London. Claiming default of rent, Honingborne immediately took control of the property, and refused to yield or accept the money when Whaston returned and offered to pay. Honingborne again refused the rent when Whaston visited him at home, but subsequently received it through his wife, and has it now in his possession. Although they now have the rent, Hicks and Honingborne 'seek still to frustrate and make void the interest of your said subject by such their indirect and extreme dealing.' undated From: 25 March 1576 To: May 1577\t  court case playhouse business Newington Butts Warwick's Men Richard Hickes Peter Honingborne Jerome Savage Richard Thompson Thomas Whaston ",

They assure the Privy Council that they have not since altered the text of the play.

The actors have been reproved and charged neither to perform the play again, nor any other 'until His Majesty's pleasure be further known.' They have bound the actors to attend upon the Board whenever they should be called. They send the book to the King's secretary so that the King may peruse it at his leisure, and call the Master of Revels before him, should he see fit.\rN. B.

They note that the present sharers receive a full moiety of the profits of the playhouse, excepting the outer doors, and that those of the housekeepers who are also actors share equally in the profits with the remaining actors. The actors' moiety, however, is used to defray the expense of the house; as a result, there is an inequality between the gains of the actors and the consortium. The three actors then explain the division and ownership of the shares in the Globe playhouse. They complain that in the redistribution of the original shares, three of Mr Heminges' four shares have gone to Mr Shanks; the players have thus been denied the chance to buy into the company. They argue that their contribution to the company is at least equal to that of others who do own shares, and suggest that they should be allowed to purchase parts of shares from those who currently have the largest interest in the playhouse. They ask, similarly, that they be permitted to buy shares in the Blackfriars of Mr Shanks, who alone holds two shares in the playhouse.

Shanks outlines the circumstances under which he purchased his shares from William Heminges, and observes that these 'were as free then for any other to buy as for your suppliant.' He then explains how he came to acquire the remainder of his shares from Heminges, and emphasizes the costs incurred in the transactions. Shanks did not 'fraudently or surreptitiously' defeat the actors' chances of purchasing the shares: Heminges would not have sold the shares the petitioners, as he would not have received as good a price of them as he did of Shanks. Shanks complains that he is an old man, and that his shares in the company are to provide for him and his family in his old age. The petitioners are false in claiming that they are unable to subsist on their present means; to support his point, Shanks gives an account of their earnings over the past year. He points, furthermore, to the expense of renting and maintaining the playhouses, and suggests that 'no wise man will adventure his estate in such a course, considering their dealing, with whom they have to do, and the many casualties and daily troubles therewith. Shanks then enumerates his various contributions to the company, and concludes in the hope that he should be allowed 'to enjoy that which he hath dearly bought and truly paid for.'

They ask that they not be deprived of their livelihood 'by men so soon shot up, since it hath been the custom that they should com to it by far more antiquity and desert than those can justly attribute to themselves.' They outline the great expense and trouble James Burbage had in building first the Theatre and then the Globe. The twenty-one year lease on the Globe, they note, has been their undoing, 'for [the members of the original consortium] dying at the expiration of three or four years of their lease, the subsequent years became dissolved to strangers, as by marrying their widows, and the like by their children. The Blackfriars, they further explain, is their inheritance; again they emphasize James Burbage's labour and expense in setting up the playhouse. They complain that 'these new men' threaten to deprive them of their livelihood; like Shanks, they point to the profits garnered by the three petitioners in the past year.

The summary includes a Latin version of the original lease between James Burbage and Giles Allen of 13 April 1576, which defines the extent of the property in question. The summary records that on 17 September 1579 James assigned his interest in the land to John Hyde, and then on 7 June 1589,  John Hyde assigned his interest and terms in the Theatre property to Cuthbert Burbage.

Woodliffe was absent at the time; upon his return, he criticized the small size of the galleries. Woodliffe gave specific advice on the measurements of the new buildings, according to which the galleries should extend about 3 or 4 feet further into the yard than they already did.\r\nSamwell says that the agreement between Samwell the elder and Woodliffe to rebuild the galleries was made between midsummer and Barholomew-tide last (i.e., late summer 1599).  The agreement was that Samwell, in return for rebuilding the galleries, Samwell would 'enjoy' the yards and galleries in addition to the premises already demised for the remaining time of the original lease with no additional rent, only the \u00a340 annually already agreed.  Samwell the younger affirms he was present at this transaction.\r\nSamwell deposes furthermore that his father and Browne spent some \u00a3300 in setting up and taking down the original small galleries, and building the larger galleries.  Samwell says that his figures are accurate, since he kept the account book for materials and labour. The stage, according to Samwell, was moved after the east galleries were 'finishing or finished.' \r\nSamwell details the means by which Browne acquired Richard Samwell's interest in the Boar's Head. Browne had lent Samwell's father \u00a3200.  Having difficulty repaying this amount, Samwell the elder made over his interest in the Boar's Head to Browne for this sum and an additional \u00a3160. Samwell the younger affirms he was present when this transaction occurred. \r\nSamwell the elder had the right to shut the gates of the inn at 11 o'clock, or whenever he and the players saw fit.\r\nSamwell deposed that Woodliffe withheld the parlour from Samwell's father for more than a year and a half, although the room had been demised to Samwell in the lease and Samwell demanded the key to it often.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n From: 11 June 1601\t From: 13 April 1598 To: 11 June 1601\t  court case performance context playhouse business Boar's Head  Robert Browne Richard, the Younger Samwell Richard, the Elder Samwell Oliver Woodliffe Susan Woodliffe ",

Once Samwell and Woodliffe had agreed to rebuild the galleries, Woodliffe directed Mago and Mago's workman Walter Rodes on the size and situation of the galleries to be built.  Woodliffe moved the stage 'which stood in the yard' another six feet away from the gallery to provide room for Samwell to build. Mago notes that when the stage was moved, there was a great deal of dung and rubbish in the yard, most of which had been thrown under the stage. \r\nMago says that Samwell erected three galleries, one each on the east, north, and south sides of the great yard. \r\nMago deposes that Woodliffe never questioned Samwell's right to build in the yard until such time as the new improved galleries were finished, except for one story of the gallery on the west side of the yard. When Mago began to remove the roof of the gallery, Woodliffe asked him to forbear until he and Samwell had discussed the story that remained to be built. \r\nMago gives the expenses for the rebuilding: the timber came to around \u00a3140, the nails to \u00a320, and the workmanship to no less that \u00a3100.\r\n\r\n\r\n From: 2 February 1600\t From: July 1599\t court case playhouse business Boar's Head  John Mago Walter Rodes Richard, the Elder Samwell Oliver Woodliffe ",

His testimony furnishes details of the dealings between James Burbage and John Brayne, and of Margaret Brayne's share in the Theatre and its profits.\r\nMiles testifies that he has seen and read the arbitrament ordered by Turner and Hill between James Burbage and John Brayne, which he says awarded Brayne a moiety of the rents and profits of the Theatre. \r\nThe arbiters had further determined that until the debt on the Theatre property was settled, neither Brayne nor Burbage should have any profits for their own use. They allowed Brayne 10s. a week 'for & towardes his house keeping' and Burbage 8s, 'of the profittes of such playes as shuld be playd there upon sundais'. Once the debt was discharged, Brayne was to receive all the rents and profits on the property until he was reimbursed for the money he had laid out in excess of Burbage's expenditure.\r\nMiles rehearses the details of the mortgage and forfeiture of the Theatre lease to John Hyde, and affirms that Margaret Brayne would have helped Burbage redeem the lease if he had revealed his intentions to her, and if he had paid her the moiety due from the Theatre profits.

Brayne's subsequently claimed that the construction of the playhouse had been his undoing. Miles claims he can produce a bond of \u00a3400 made by Burbage to Brayne to secure the moiety of the Theatre's profits to Brayne and his heirs. Miles says this bond was made by Burbage so that he could secure the lease in his own name only. \r\nAccording to Miles, Burbage confessed to having spent no more than \u00a3100 on the building of the Theatre, which Miles believes is true, as Burbage was only a poor player and had no credit. He estimates Brayne spent at least \u00a3600 or \u00a3700, abandoned his grocery business, and ran even further into debt. \r\nMiles says Burbage made a 'secret key' for the money box shortly after the Theatre was in operation, which he used to steal sums of money. By this means Burbage cheated both Brayne and the players.\r\nHe has been a witness to the disagreements between John Brayne and James Burbage over the Theatre. Richard Turner and John Hill acted as arbiters in the matter, and concluded that Brayne and Burbage should share equally in the profits of the Theatre and its property. They also determined that, if it became necessary to mortgage the lease on the Theatre property, Brayne and Burbage should share equally in the mortgage, and that the profits made on the property should go toward the redemption of the lease.\r\nMiles affirms that the lease was mortgaged and then forfeited to John Hyde, but that Hyde always promised, before and after Brayne's death, that he would not execute the lease if he were paid the money owed, but that he would only give back the lease to both Burbage and John or Margaret Brayne together, not any one individually. Miles then claims that James Burbage intentionally forfeited the lease so that he could renew it without the Braynes, and that Hyde was pressured into making the lease over to Cuthbert Burbage through the intervention of Sir Walter Cope. Miles estimates that the Burbages have received 2000 marks from the Theatre, and that Margaret is entitled to a moiety of that plus the recovery of other outlays. \r\n\r\n\r\n From: 30 July 1592\t From: 13 April 1576 To: Spring 1591\t  court case playhouse business Theatre  Giles Allen Braye John Brayne Margaret Brayne James Burbage Cuthbert Burbage Mr Walter Cope John Hill John Hyde Robert Miles Richard Turner ",

Lanman then give details of the agreement made less just less than seven years ago, between himself, Burbage and John Brayne to share the profits of the Theatre and Curtain for a period of seven years.

Nicoll says that on 9 August 1577 he drew up an indenture of a lease between James Burbage and John Brayne to share ownership of the lease on the Theatre property, since the original lease from Giles Allen was in Burbage's name only. Nicoll believes that Burbage never in fact sealed the indenture, as the lease had been pawned for funds to build the Theatre. Therefore, on 22 May 1578, Brayne had Nicoll draw up another obligation in which Burbage bound himself to Brayne for \u00a3400 for half the profits of the Theatre property. Burbage sealed this agreement before Nicoll and John Gardiner. Shortly after the document was sealed, however, Burbage and Brayne fell into an argument about the amount each contributed to the Theatre which resulted in a violent altercation. Thereafter, on 12 July 1578, Richard Turner and John Hill arbitrated the dispute between Burbage and Brayne, and the award was by Nicoll and George Gosse, his apprentic'. Nicoll estimates that Burbage did not contribute more than \u00a3100 toward building the Theatre.

At the same time, James Burbage mortgaged the lease on the Theatre and its property to Hyde, on the condition that if the borrowed sum was repaid to Hyde within twelve months and a day, Hyde should return the lease to Burbage. He recalls that the lease and other bonds were made over to him 'at the time of the said conveyance sealed by the defendant', and that Brayne agreed to the arrangement. Burbage, Brayne and Prynn were bound to Hyde for a further \u00a3200 as security against the repayment of the mortgage.\r\n\r\nJohn Hyde testifies that, offended at James Burbage and John Brayne's failure to repay their debt, he threatened to take possession of the Theatre property and had Burbage arrested sometime around June, 1582. Attended by his arresting officer, Burbage then went to Hyde's house and left \u00a320 with his wife. He was discharged on the condition that he would return when Hyde sent for him. Burbage complained that Brayne had seized a large portion of the profits from the Theatre, which he would neither share with Burbage, nor pay to Hyde. Hyde thereupon dismissed Brayne's interest in the Theatre property and title. Because Brayne refused to deliver any of the money he had received, Hyde was forced to appoint Burbage and a servant to collect \u00a35 a week from the Theatre profits, whereby he received some \u00a320 or \u00a330.\r\n\r\nAfter John Brayne's death, Hyde stated that the lease and bonds would be 'set over and assigned' to George Clough, Hyde's father in law, but this did not in fact occur.  Hyde suggests that Clough did visit Burbage to evict him from the Theatre, or at least to threaten him; Burbage responded that he could not leave, as he 'had set down and prescribed to him for the redemption of his said lease.'\r\n\r\n From: 8 December 1590\t From: 26 September 1579 To: 1589\t  court case playhouse business Theatre  Giles Allen Sara Allen John Brayne Margaret Brayne James Burbage Cuthbert Burbage George Clough Mr Walter Cope John Hyde John Prynne ",

Woodford purchased this share from Stone on 17 June 1612, and deputized his servant Anthony Payne to pay the rent and collect the profits during Woodford's absence from London.  Woodford accuses Holland of refusing to accept payment from Payne and then cancelling the agreement upon Woodford's return. \r\nWoodford then gives extensive details of the series of lawsuits he then initiated to retrieve his due profits.

The bill details Burbage and Brayne's dealings over the Theatre from the beginning of Brayne's partnership to Brayne's death. Burbage entered into a contract with Brayne, and became bound to him for \u00a3400, on the condition that Brayne would leave his interest in the property to Burbage's children upon his death. Burbage blames Brayne's profligate building expenditures on Burbage's inability to repay his debt and redeem the lease. Burbage submitted to the judgment of the arbiters in granting Brayne control over the profits of the Theatre, but Brayne conspired with Robert Miles and one Tomson to bankrupt Burbage and deprive him and his heirs of interest in the property. On his deathbed, Brayne promised his interest in the Theatre property to Burbage's children, and his bonds to Burbage himself. Since then, John Gardiner's executors and Robert Miles have taken control of Brayne's property, claiming that Brayne made them the beneficiaries of the will. And now Brayne's widow has had Burbage arrested on the pretense that he has not fulfilled the terms prescribed by the arbiters, and has forfeited the \u00a3400 bond; she denies, furthermore, that Brayne meant to leave his share to Burbage's children. Miles, Gardiner's executors, and Margaret Brayne have joined forces against Burbage, claiming the lease is forfeit, and refusing to grant Burbage's children their interest. Burbage is unable to enforce Brayne's bequest, as it was made in secret in the presence only of Miles and other witness who have now gone beyond the seas.

She says Beeston and the company agreed to pay her this amount in installments, but only after the Robert Sidney, now the Earl of Leicester, in his then capacity as Lord Chamberlain of Queen Anne's household, intervened on her behalf.\r\nShe then says that after her marriage to James Baskervile, he was invited in June 1615 to invest \u00a357 10s in the company for a further annuity of 20p a day. The company only paid this amount for a month, and according to Baskervile they were in arrears \u00a342 by June 1616. The answer then details the negotiations by which the company agreed to resume and increase the daily payments in return for further investments, and her subsequent struggles, in which she is joined by her trustee William Jordan, to receive the payments. She gives an alternate and more detailed version of events leading to the June 1617 agreement from that given in the bill of complaint (including the non-payment of acting wages to her son William Browne). According to Baskervile, the agreement included performances by the company at the Cockpit/Phoenix as well as the Red Bull. The key requirement for payment to her or her assigns is that four or more of the player/sharers named play together near London or at court. Baskervile then gives the details of various bonds between the players and Jordan to guarantee the payments. She then denies that she in any way colluded with Beeston, and contradicts many of the particulars in the bill of complaint concerning the agreements with the company for her annuity payments.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, the answer provides evidence that the company moved back to the Red Bull following the apprentices riot of 4 March 1617, and performed there until the Cockpit was repaired, 'on or about the third day of June' 1617.

        " George Androwes sues Martin Slatier over events at the Whitefriars during February and March 1608. He complains that Lording Barry, pretending to be possessed of a moiety of the Whitefriars property, joined with Martin Slatier to persuade Androwes to invest in a sixth of the property, promising Androwes that he would receive great benefit from his investment. Barry claimed that the playhouse's apparel alone was worth \u00a3400, of which Androwes would own a sixth part, and suggested furthermore that Androwes would make a profit of \u00a3100 a year on the playhouse. Androwes entered into a contract with Barry and Slatier for a term of six years, eight months and twenty days, and paid \u00a370 for his share. He subsequently discovered that the apparel was worth not more than \u00a35. The charges of maintaining the playhouse and company, moreover, were exceedingly high; rather than make a profit, he lost around \u00a3300. The lease on the playhouse, moreover, was forfeited for non-payment of rent, and Androwes faced losing his investment. In order to maintain their hold on the playhouse, the various parties concerned [Lording Barry, Michael Drayton, William Trevell, William Cooke, Edward Sibthorpe, John Mason] bound themselves to Martin Slatier for \u00a3200. The articles of their agreement, drafted 10 March 1607/8, were as follows:\r1. Slatier was to have a sixth share in the profits of the playhouse for the duration of the lease.\r2. Slatier and his family were to have lodgings in the house.\r3. Slatier was to have the sole benefit of any profits made from the sale of commodities in the playhouse [alcohol, tobacco, etc].\r4. Slatier and Drayton were to travel with the children during periods when there were restraints on playing in London.\r5. If any of the sharers was to remove property from the playhouse worth in excess of 2s without the consent of his fellow-sharers, he would forfeit his interest in the playhouse.\r6. A sixth part of the weekly charges for the playhouse was to be taken out of each day's profits, by which means they would avoid going into debt.\r7. The children were bound to Martin Slatier for a term of three years. Slatier was to be bound to the company for \u00a340 that he would not discharge any of the children without the consent of the rest of the company.\r8. No member of the company was to allow the company's playbooks to be put into print, at a penalty of \u00a340, with the exception of Tourrismount, which was to be printed only after twelve months had expired.\r9. During times when playing was prohibited in London and the company forced to travel, Slatier was to have an allowance of one and a half shares.\r10. All the parties agree to the above terms.\rThe \u00a3200 obligation would be void, as long as the terms of the contract were met. Androwes had Slatier's assurance that any breaches of the contract committed by his fellows would not affect his own obligations; he believes that others among the company may have broken the contract, but attests that he has not. Slatier has nevertheless had Androwes arrested into the King's Bench, with the intention of claiming of Androwes the amount of the forfeited bond.

        " Martin Slatier responds to George Androwes' bill of complaint. It is true, he believes, that Lording Barry had a moiety in the Whitefriars property, and that Barry had this from Thomas Woodford. He denies that he persuaded Androwes to invest in a sixth part of the messuage, as Androwes entered into the contract with Barry before Slatier knew him. He does not know the value of the apparel, or Barry's asking price for the share, but believes that Androwes paid Barry \u00a370 and no more. Slatier argues that the \u00a3300 Androwes claims to have lost would have been disbursed long after Androwes entered into the original agreement, and therefore spent with Androwes' consent. He denies that Androwes carried most of the burden of expense for the playhouse charges, and argues that Androwes cannot claim default of profits he hoped or expected to make in the venture. Slatier cannot be held responsible for Androwes' financial disappointment, nor is it any of his concern if the playhouse lease was forfeited. He confesses that he did enter into an agreement with the concerned parties on 10 March 1608, and that they were bound to him for \u00a3200. He denies having agreed that Androwes would be bound only for his own acts, that the other sharers had broken the terms of the contract without Androwes' knowledge, and that Androwes' himself has done nothing to breach the agreement.

On the advice of one of the Queen's players, Fleetwood ordered the owner of the Theatre (James Burbage) to be arrested, but he refused because he was 'my Lo of hunsdons man.'  He did bind himself to appear at the sessions of oyer and terminer, 'where he said that he was sure the court would not bind him.' Fleetwood notes that Burbage is due to appear before the sessions tomorrow, and is convinced that Burbage will be bound, or worse.\r\nFleetwood writes that 'very nere the Theatre or Curten at the tyme of the Playes' a gentleman, Challes, disturbed an apprentice sleeping the field and they soon fell to blows. The altercation escalated so that many apprentices threatened to riot the next day, and many were arrested. \r\nFleetwood also describes an altercation at the Theatre door between a serving man named Browne and 'certain poor boys, handicraft apprentices'. A crowd of 1,050 gathered to witness the quarrel. Browne, the aggressor, attempted to escape, but was 'taken after'.

It would be a danger to the Queen to be in such close proximity to a company that, in performing for the public, might be exposed to the infection of plague.\r\n2. The problem of the company's poverty since being restricted to playing outside of London does not concern them, as playing is in any case a dishonest way of making a living.\r\n3. The order of toleration which allowed the company to perform on holidays has expired. \r\n4. the solution to the problem of short daylight hours in the winter is to find a new form of employment. \r\n5. To play during plague is to risk the spread of infection and to do so at other times is offend God.\r\n6. Even when the number of plague-related deaths is small, the threat of infection remains, as there is no system in place to account for those who have recovered but are still contagious. Therefore playing should not be permitted only because the danger seems to have abated.\r\n7. The token-based system of accounting for plague-related deaths inaccurate; there is no reason, therefore, to tolerate playing when the number of deaths seems to fall. It would be unfair to risk the health of the general population in the interest of a few of the Queen's servants.\r\n8. It would be acceptable to permit playing when the number of deaths in the City falls to normal non-plague levels.\r\n9. They do not object to the suggestion that only the Queen's Men be allowed to play in London, but note that the last time such an order was in place, the City was deluged with companies pretending to be the Queen's Men.\r\nTheir remedies to the players complaints are as follows:\r\n1. The players should confine their playing to private houses.\r\n2. If more [playing? companies] are to be tolerated, they must abide by the orders laid out in the Act of Common Council, temp. Hawes.\r\n3. Playing should be allowed only when the number of deaths in the City falls below 50.\r\n4. There shall be no plays on the Sabbath.\r\n5. There shall be no plays on holidays until after evening prayer.\r\n6. There is to be no playing in the dark; all audience members must be allowed sufficient time to return home before it is dark.\r\n7. Only the Queen's company should be allowed to play, and members must not form themselves into several companies.\r\n8. The toleration will be revoked if any of the above orders are broken.

        "Thomas Platter -- a Swiss traveller -- visits the Theatre, Cockpit and Bear Garden Thomas Platter, a Swiss traveller, visits London between 18 September and 20 October 1599. He provides accounts of visits to the theatres and bear garden, and furnishes details of theatrical culture, practice and infrastructure. \r\n\r\nOn 21 September, Platter attends a performance of 'die Tragedy vom ersten Keyser Julio Caesare' [the tragedy of the first Emperor Julius Caesar] at a straw-roofed playhouse [the Globe]. The play features approximately 15 actors, and the performance ends with a dance. Later in his trip, Platter sees a comedy performed at an unnamed playhouse [the Curtain] in Bishopsgate; again, the performance ends with a dance. \r\n\r\nEvery day at two o'clock, Platter observes, as many as two or three performances run simultaneously at different houses around the city. Plays are staged on raised platforms, and audiences pay one penny to stand in the galleries, two to sit, and three for a cushioned seat. Refreshments are served during intermission.\r\n\r\nPlayers dress in the most costly and delicate items, which they purchase from the estates of knights and gentry for very little money.\r\n\r\nThere is a house near the Horsemarket, built like a theatre, that runs cockfights for three-quarters of the year. The cocks fight on a round table covered in straw. Audience members stand around the table, and place bets on the fight, which may last as much as hour or five hours.\r\n\r\nSundays and Wednesdays there is bear- and bullbaiting across the water; Platter attends a show on Sunday, 19th September. The showplace [Schauplatz] is built in the round; the ground level offers unreserved open-air space. Bears' teeth are broken off so they cannot injure the dogs.\r\n\r\nThe English pass the time in these and other ways. As most do not travel, they attend the theatre to learn about other countries and foreign matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n From: after 18 September 1599 To: before 20 October 1599\t  From: after 18 September 1599 To: before 20 October 1599\t  bear-baiting  cockfighting cultural context performance performance context player context playhouse context Bear Garden Bel Savage Blackfriars (II) Boar's Head Curtain Fortune (I) Globe (I) Rose Swan  Thomas Platter ",

The description of the projected theatre discusses first the frame, then the stage and tiring house, the windows and lights, the tiling of the frame and staircases, and details of the ceiling and floors. In each particular, the design of the new playhouse is to follow the plan of the Globe, 'saving only that all the principal and main posts of the said frame and stage forward shall be square and wrought plasterwise with carved proportions called satyrs to be placed and set on top of every of the same posts.' Street is to provide the materials at his own 'proper costs and charges' and is to complete the building before 25 July of the same year. Henslowe and Alleyn are to pay Street \u00a3440 for the job: \u00a3220 when the frame is raised, and another \u00a3220 when the job is finished.

        "Chancery, Margaret Brayne vs the Burbages: John Alleyn deposes John Alleyn, an actor, deposes in Margaret Brayne's suit against the Burbages.  Alleyn affirms that there was an arbitrament made between James Burbage and John Brayne to settle their dispute over the Theatre profits and that although he is not certain what the terms were, he has heard that they agreed to split the profits equally. He says that Brayne and Burbage did mortgate the Theatre for \u00a3125 and then forfeit that mortgage to John Hyde. He states that James Burbage 'did detayne the proffites of the premisses in his own handes of purpose that the said morgage shuld be forfetted.'  Alleyn says that Margaret Brayne did for a short time receive profits from the Theatre.  \r\nAlleyn then provides a colorful account of several violent encounters between partisans of Margaret Brayne, including Robert Miles, and the Burbages.  When attempts were made to collect the Theatre profits, Richard Burbage threatened them with a broomstick, and promised next time he would meet them with pistols.

Hyde and Clough both lent money to Brayne and Burbage to finance the operation of the Theatre. Burbage asks whether Brayne kept profits of the playhouse for himself while in default to Hyde and Clough. Burbage asks how much money Hyde and Clough received from sending their own servants to collect \u00a35 a week at the Theatre since Brayne would not pay them directly.

        "Requests, Woodford vs Holland: Woodford states his case Thomas Woodford makes his complaint in his 1619 suit against Aaron Holland in the Court of Requests over the disagreement concerning the share of profits in the Red Bull.\r\nWoodford says that Holland built the Red Bull after obtaining a lease from Anne Bedingfield, widow of Christopher Bedingfield. According to Woodford, Holland then granted one-seventh of the profits of the playhouse and galleries to Thomas Swinnerton. Swinnerton then sold his share in 1608 to Philip Stone for \u00a350 pounds, of which he would lend \u00a320 to Holland interest free for one year. The rent for the share would be 50s, but Woodford says that Holland and Swinnerton colluded to defraud Stone, \"a simple and ignorant man,\" with a lease that did not include all the conditions promised. Stone, running into financial trouble, then sold Woodford this misrepresented lease for \u00a350 in 1612. Woodford collected the profits for one quarter of the year, then left London, deputizing his servant Anthony Payne to pay the rent and collect the profits during Woodford's absence.  Woodford accuses Holland of refusing to accept payment from Payne, promising that no harm would come to Woodford's interest, and then cancelling the agreement upon Woodford's return. \r\nWoodford then details the progress of his previous suits to regain his share of the profits in the Red Bull. He accuses Holland of pretending to be illiterate in order to avoid granting a new lease as directed by the court, and colluding with his lawyer Ralph Wormleighton to avoid performing the court's orders when in Woodford's favour. Woodford also accuses Holland of using Mary Phillips to collude with Phillip Stone, offering him money to release him from any suits undertaking in Stone's name after Woodford had initiated such a suit in Stone's name. Woodford finally admits that he does not have a copy of the agreement between Holland and Stone because they have connived to gather up all copies and deliberately hide them from Woodford.

Alleyn says that in or around 1611 Henslowe agreed to pay \u00a38 annual rent for a period of twenty-four years, for a moiety of the profits from the Fortune and its surrounding tenements. This rent was offset by Henslowe allowing Alleyn and his family to occupy or make use of tenements near the Bear Garden for the same tenure. William Henslowe inherited Philip's properties and leases after his death (6 January 1616), at which point fifty years remained on the properties Philip had leased from the Bishop of Winchester.

The document is divided into five parts, A-E, as follows:\rA. The first section of the survey concerns the responsibilities of the freeholders to contribute to the parish church.\rB. The second part of the survey gives an account of how, and among whom, the Blackfriars property is divided.\rC. The survey then provides details of Cawerden's portion of the property, upon which eventually the Blackfriars theatre was to be constructed.\rD. The survey next provides an estimate of Cawerden's charges in building, and emphasizes that construction has been confined to his property.\rE. The survey concludes that Cawerden has been entirely within his rights, and that his work on the property has been a benefit to the community.  Blackfriars (I)   ",

If he have none, then it is passed in other pleasures.\u2019  Again he said:  \u2018Look but upon the common plays in London, and see the multitudes that flocketh to them and followeth them; behold the sumptuous theatre houses, a continual monument of London\u2019s prodigality and folly. But I understand they are now forbidden because of the Plague.   I like the policy well if it hold still, for a disease is but botched or patched up that is not cured in the cause, and the cause of plagues is sin, if you look to it well; and because of sin are plays; therefore the cause of plagues are plays.\u2019\u201d  St Paul's Cross   ",

His testimony provides some detail concerning the original financial transactions between Burbage and Brayne. He professes himself ignorant on most points of the interrogation. \r\nCollyns, who as apprenticed to a neighbor of Brayne's, speaks of Brayne's reputed wealth at the time he entered into the Theatre project (about \u00a31000), and of the financial problems Brayne encountered as he abandoned his profession of grocer to concentrate on the Theatre. Collyns give specific details of Brayne's debts and outlays toward the building of the Theatre.

He does claim to have heard that Burbage and Brayne agreed the lease on the playhouse would be in Burbage's name only, but that both would have the use of it.

Allen thinks that Burbage entered into a bond for the premium on the lease, and does not believe that the debt for this is yet fully discharged. Brayne paid nothing to Allen, as the debt was Burbage's alone.

The order has been read as a direct response to a kind of neighbourhood dissolution effected by the presence of the newly built Swan playhouse (_The Survey of London_ [London, 1950], 22, p 97, 'Bankside'; quoted in Ingram, '\"Neere the Playhouse,\"' p 54). Ingram refutes this reading, observing that the statute 'was not a contrivance of the steward of the manor, or of his representatives, but was one of the accomplishments of the Parliament of 1592' (p 57). The statute, that is, was neither confined to Paris Garden, nor could it have been prompted by the construction of the Swan in early 1596. The order of October 1596 is a reiteration of an existing statute, under which several persons are indicted during the same session.

Ireland refers to Newton as a player in the Duke of York's Men, who play at the Boar's Head. He reports Newton saying that he makes as much as five shillings a day as a sharer. \r\n\r\nIreland affirms that he was present when William Duke solicited Waters on behalf of Newton, and that Waters desired to see and speak with Newton.  \r\nIreland was present at the Crown and Goat in Smithfield when Newton and Waters met in the company of Duke and Newton's sister, about a fortnight after Michaelmas.  Waters and Newton were 'drinking one to another & kissing & embracing together very lovinglye' and Waters kissed Newton's neck so that three red spots arose.  Ireland reports that Waters said these spots meant she marked Newton as her own. \r\n\r\nNewton and Waters left for a while, then reappeared at the tavern later that evening.  Waters invited Newton back to her house and they, along with Ireland and Gregory Saunders, went there. After Waters and Newton kissed some more, Saunders suggested they join hands and marry each other.  Saunders pronounced them man and wife and the newlyweds kissed.\r\n\r\nA few days later Newton and Waters met at the Queen's Head and signed marriage contracts which had been drawn up by Ireland (copied from the Book of Common Prayer), and witnessed by Ireland and William Addison. Ireland cannot remember exactly how much wine was drunk or money spent, but he does say that Waters was not overcome with wine, but 'of good capacitie' and she understood the note she signed. The two contracts were then exchanged by the spouses. Waters asked Ireland to procure a license to solemnize the marriage.\r\n\r\nBefore the Queen's Head meeting, Waters had resisted Ireland's urgings to solemnize the marriage, saying she refused to marry before she delivered the child (from her deceased husband) she was carrying, in order to avoid scandal.\r\n\r\nIreland, Newton and Waters met again at Waters' house about a week later to arrange a wedding. Newton and Waters again asked Ireland to procure a license, and they decided to get married at Burntwood in Essex.  Ireland adds that he visited the house a number of mornings to find Waters and Newton in bed together.\r\n\r\n From: 17 February 1611 To: 14 June 1611\t  From: October 1610 To: February 1611\t  court case player context Boar's Head Curtain Prince Charles' Men (c1609-1625) William Addison William Duke George Ireland John Newton Newton's sister Gregory Saunders Joan Waters ",

Foscarini is given to visiting playhouses, accompanied by a single servant. The other day he went to the Curtain, 'a place as dubious as they come, and where you would never see the face of a gentleman.' Rather than pay a sixpence, Foscarini chose to stand in the yard ' among the rabble of porters and carters. When the players invited the audience to pick a play for the next day, Foscarini made a spectacle of himself by calling out a title. undated undated audience context performance playhouse context Curtain  Antonio Foscarini ",

London has seven theatres, which present plays [comodien] every day except Sunday. The best of these is the Globe [der glbs], which lies across the water. The theatre in which the children play is on this side of the water [ie in the City]; performances run at 3pm, but only from Michaelmas through Easter. Admission to the children's theatre is half a shilling, but as much as half a crown at the other place [ie the Globe]. The Globe plays only by candlelight, and has the best company in London. There is also a house in which bears and hares are baited with dogs.

There would be none in my opinion, fitter then thy selfe to play his parts: my conceipt is such of thee, that I durst venture all the mony in my purse on thy head, to play Hamlet with him for a wager.' \r\nFollowing this speech, Ratsey dubs the player 'Sir Simon two shares and a half' (though Collier will mistranscribe this, 'Sir Three-shares and a half').\r\nCollier notes that this passage may refer to Richard Burbage.

        "Leonard Digges commemorates Shakespeare and disparages current playwrights Leonard Digges provides a commendatory poem to the 1640 edition of Shakespeare's poems, in which he praises Shakespeare at the expense of other playwrights. He says that the King's Men remain the supreme London company because of Shakespeare's plays, and advises other playwrights to sell to other companies at the Red Bull, Cockpit/Phoenix, and Fortune instead. He writes that even Ben Jonson's plays are not well attended at the Blackfriars, but that Shakespeare's plays still fill the galleries and boxes.

They assure the Privy Council that they have not since altered the text of the play. The Privy Council notes that the poet responsible for the play is Thomas Middleton; they have issued a warrant for his arrest. The actors have been reproved and charged neither to perform the play again, nor any other 'until His Majesty's pleasure be further known.' They have bound the actors to attend upon the Board whenever they should be called. They send the book to the King's secretary so that the King may peruse it at his leisure, and call the Master of Revels before him, should he see fit.\r\nN. B.

The answer contends that according to the original lease for the Globe property, the lessees were responsible for 'all such edifices and buildings whatsoeuer' to be delivered to the lessor upon the expiration of the lease, and that this provision corresponds to the low rent amount that Nicholas Brend agreed upon. The answer also contends that any damage due to 'negligence or ill keepeinge of theire fire' remains the responsibility of the lessees, and has no bearing on the term of the lease. The answer states that Brend does not believe any agreement settled by Sir John Bodley or any other of his family prior to his reaching the age of maturity 'to be materiall... or to binde him att all', and that the cost of the playhouse could not exceed 'ffiue hundred poundes'. The answer concludes by stating that any extension of the lease would be a disadvantage to his inheritance, and that the property would find more profit with tenements than a playhouse.

The complaint begins by recounting the terms of the original lease with Nicholas Brend and the cost of building the first Globe, which they claim was 'One Thowsand pounds of lawfull English money at the least'. It goes on to describe how the playhouse was 'by Casualty of fire vtterly ruinated burnt downe and Consumed', and that while at the time he had not yet reached the age of twenty-one, the young Matthew Brend had agreed with his caretakers to extend the terms of the lease by six years to 'inhable and incourage' the lessees to rebuild the structure. This extension, composed by Brend's uncle Sir John Bodley, also contained the provision to renew the lease further with a payment of ten pounds when 'Sr Mathewe Brend hath accomplished his age of one and Twenty yeeres'.

        "Star Chamber, Samwell vs Langley et al: Francis Langley deposes Francis Langley deposes in the case brought against him and others by Richard Samwell the Elder. The deposition provides information about the disagreement over ownership of the galleries in the inn, and of Langley's legal campaign against the Samwells.\r\n\r\nLangley says that the galleries were built in the great yard, which had not been demised by Woodliffe to Samwell, and therefore the galleries were in the possession of Woodliffe, who sold his interest in the inn to Langley by an indenture of 7 November 1599.\r\n\r\nLangley denies that he procured Anthony Strayles, Alexander Foxley, John Johnston, or Peter Boulton to invade the inn and assault Samwell and his son on 16 December, but that Strayles, Foxley, Johnston, and Boulton did enter the inn on that day to lawfully arrest Samwell at the suit of Oliver Woodliffe. Samwell submitted to arrest but was soon rescued by his son who, Langley heard, assaulted the marshal's men. No one to Langley's knowledge threw a dagger at the Samwells.\r\n\r\nLangley says that neither he nor any one in his company forcibly entered the inn armed on 23 or 24 December, but that on 24 December he did send Strayles to collect money from those in the galleries who came to see the play, amounting to about 5s.\r\n\r\nLangley denies that he or his agents collected money from the galleries on St. Stephen's Day (26 December), but that he and Strayles did attempt to collect gallery money that day, since the galleries stand upon his ground, but were prevented by Samwell the younger.  Owen Roberts cut down certain parts of the galleries by his command around Christmas, but only Langley and Roberts were present when this was done.\r\n\r\nLangley responds that around last Christmas Samwell the younger was arrested twice for trespass, once at the suit of Richard Bishop and once of Thomas Wolleston. Edward Willys, Samwell's servant, was also arrested for trespass around the same time at Bishop's suit. He denies that he procured Winifred Samwell's arrest, nor does he know anything of fees collected for the arrests. He denies Samwell's accusation that he or anyone else forged warrants for the arrests. He does not know of any arrests other than those he has mentioned. \r\n\r\nLangley has heard that Foxley, Johnson, and Boulton arrested Winifred on a warrant from the Court of Marshalsea for participating in the rescue of Samwell the Elder from arrest, but he procured neither that arrest, nor any other of Samwell and his servants.\r\n\r\nThe actions against Samwell the younger and Willys now pending in the Court of Marshalsea are at the suit of Richard Bishop, and were drawn up by an attorney at that court. Bishop is above twenty years old, has a lease on part of the Boar's Head from Thomas Wolleston by an indenture dated 15 December 1599, and did indeed initiate all the actions undertaken in his name.\r\n\r\nLangley insists that the only suits he has entered into are those already cited, and he has financed only suits involving his title to the Boar's Head. He has not prosecuted the suits in order to cause the Samwell family grief. He was acquainted with the arrest of the younger Samwell in the King's Bench at the suit of Wolleston. \r\n\r\n From: 30 April 1600\t From: 7 November 1599 To: 30 April 1600\t  court case performance performance context playhouse business playhouse context Boar's Head  Richard Bishop Peter Boulton Alexander Foxley John Johnson Richard Langley Owen Roberts Richard, the Younger Samwell Mrs Winifred Samwell Richard, the Elder Samwell Anthony Strayles Edward Willys Thomas Wolleston Oliver Woodliffe ",

He claims, first of all, that Savage arranged for a convenant to be inserted in the indenture of the lease, by which Hickes was bound that he had full power, right and authority to demise and grant the said messuage.' In his simplicity, Hickes sealed a bond of \u00a3100 to perform the covenant, which Honingborne claims Savage meant to make him forfeit immediately after it was sealed. He notes, secondly, that Hickes granted a reversion of the property to himself, in partial satisfaction of an obligation; Savage was aware of the arrangment, and accepted Honingborne as his landlord. As regards the payment of the rent, Honingborne went to collect the money on the fourteenth day, and waited a whole hour without received anything, after which he took possession.

        "Chancery, Woodford vs Holland: Holland answers",
        "Chancery, Woodford vs Holland: Holland answers Aaron Holland answers Thomas Woodford's bill of complaint in the last of the lawsuits between the two men arising from the share of profits in the Red Bull. \r\nHolland explains that at the time of the conflict (1612) he was 'lawfully possessed' of the Red Bull property, upon which 'to his great charge and and expenses' he had erected a playhouse. He granted to Thomas Swinnerton, then a member of Queen Anne's company, an eighteenth share of the profits in the playhouse. He denies, however, as Woodford has claimed, that Swinnerton received 3d a day as a gatherer. If Swinnerton did received such an amount, it was not as part of his eighteenth share, but either as part of a special arrangment, or out of Woodford's own favour to Swinnerton. Swinnerton made an agreement with Philp Stone to sell his share in the Red Bull, but is not aware that Stone paid Swinnerton \u00a350 for this. He believes, rather, that Swinnerton recieved around \u00a325, paid in small sums. At the request of the two men, Holland transferred Swinnerton's share in the playhouse to Stone in an indenture dated 30 February 1609; the term of the contract was for 25 and three-quarter years. In return for his share in the playhouse, Stone was to pay Holland \u00a32 10s a year; were Stone to default on this payment, the contract would be void. Holland insists that the contract made no mention of a gatherer's place worth 3d a day. Stone and Woodford nevertheless collected this sum on a regular basis, on the pretence that the contract gave them the right to do so. When Holland demanded restitution of these sums, Stone refused and sold his share to Woodford. In his bill of complaint, Woodford claims that he sent an agent, Anthony Payne to pay the yearly rent of \u00a32 10s, but that Holland refused the sum; Holland denies this. Rather, Holland claims that he had no dealings whatsoever with Woodford over the playhouse, but that he continued to consider the share as Stone's. Having thus received no rent from Stone, Holland considered the contract void, and the share forfeit. He believes that he had good reason to forfeit the share, as the sum Stone had claimed as gatherer far exceeded the profits of an eighteenth share. Holland notes, furthermore, that he offered to restore the share on condition that Stone repay the sums he had wrongly claimed. At this point, however, Woodford brought his first suit against Holland, whereupon Holland reiterated his offer to restore the share upon return of the wrongfully gotten money. When the case finally went to arbitrament, Holland was awarded twenty marks as restitution for the sums Stone had wrongfully collected. Woodford, however, refused to pay the sum, and before Holland had a chance to take legal action against him, initiated another suit in the Court of Requests, which Holland countered with a writ of prohibition from the King's Bench. Woodford then tendered Holland an indenture drawn up according to Stone's former deed in the playhouse, which Holland put off sealing, hoping instead that the matter might be settled in arbitrament. The two parties subsequently bound themselves for \u00a320 to defer to the judgment of the arbiter. The arbiter decided as follows: 1. Holland was to make a new grant to Woodford for an eighteenth share in the playhouse; 2. Holland should enjoy the gatherer's place; 3. Holland should not be responsible for repaying any of the money collected on the share since its forfeiture; 4. Woodford should pay Holland \u00a32 in arrears rent; 5. all suits between the two parties should come to an end. Following the judgement, Holland assumed that all would be well; Woodford, however, refused shortly thereafter to pay his quarterly rent. At this point, Holland felt it necessary to put into action the writ of prohibition he had procured from the King's Bench; Woodford, predictably, fought against it. When Woodford's attempts here proved futile, he brought another suit against Holland in the Court of Requests, this time in Philip Stone's name. Holland then met with Stone, who willingly signed a document in which released his claim on the property in perpetuity. He denies having paid Stone for the document. Woodford then sued Holland in the Court of King's Bench, again in Stone's name, on a different matter. The expense of these several lawsuits has forced Holland to borrow substantially, and to sell his interest in the Red Bull property.

The company claims that Baskervile colluded with Christopher Beeston, the manager of the company, against the interests of the other players. According to the plaintiffs, despite a difficult series of negotiations formalizing the agreement in June 1617, they have continued paying the agreed upon 3s 8p per playing day for ten years to a total of \u00a3500 without getting much in return from Baskervile or her assigns and heirs other than an initial investment of not more than \u00a350.

        "Chancery, Margaret Brayne vs the Burbages: interrogatories for Griggs, Collyns, Miles, Lanman and Nicoll Margaret Brayne prepares questions for a number of deponents in her Chancery suit against James and Cuthbert Burbage. Brayne asks several questions concerning the building of the Theatre by James Burbage and John Brayne, and the sharing of its profits and costs. She emphasizes John Brayne's involvement in the project, and the questions accuse Burbage of pilfering the profits for himself.  Margaret Brayne then asks questions about the disagreements between Burbage and Brayne, the subsequent arbitrament, and the forfeited mortgage made with John Hyde. The questions detail Margaret's failed attempt to recover the mortgaged lease from Hyde (on the condition that she still share the moiety with Burbage), and accuse Burbage of intentionally forfeiting the mortgaged lease so that he could make a new lease in the name of his son, thereby cutting Margaret out of her share in the Theatre. Three more questions were added concerning the 13 November 1590 order enforcing the 12 July 1578 arbitrament.  undated From: 13 April 1576 To: Spring 1591\t  court case playhouse business Theatre  Giles Allen Margaret Brayne John Brayne James Burbage Cuthbert Burbage Edward Collyns Mr Walter Cope John Griggs John Hill John Hyde Henry Lanman Robert Miles William Nicoll Richard Turner ",

        "Requests, Cuthbert Burbage vs Allen: interrogatories for Miles and Miles Giles Allen submits several questions to be asked of Robert and Raphe Miles on his behalf in Cuthbert Burbage's Court of Requests suit against him concerning the Theatre properties. The deponents are asked whether a lease in evidence is the one which James Burbage drew up to renew his interest in the Theatre properties owned by Allen, and whether Allen agreed to that lease. They are asked whether James Burbage spent \u00a3200 on improvements, whether he has kept the property in good repair, and whether they have known Allen to complain that Burbage was a poor tenant consistently behind in his rent. Allen asks whether Cuthbert and his brother make James' widow Ellen executrix so that she, a poor woman, would not be required to pay the \u00a330 still owed to Allen upon James' death. Allen also asks whether John Brayne was a partner in the building of the Theatre, and how much the Burbage's have profited from the Theatre. He finally asks whether James Burbage subleased his interest in some of the property to John Hyde.

Miles says that James Burbage did draw up a renewal of the lease, but the Allen refused to sign it; he can say no more since there is no copy of the lease to review. Miles affirms that he has heard that James did spend at least \u00a3200 on improving the property, and that as far as he knows Burbage and Brayne did keep the property in good repair, but that he has not seen the property recently. Miles agrees with Allen's theory that Cuthbert and Richard Burbage assumed most of James' goods, but made their mother Ellen the executrix of James' estate in order to disappoint  creditors. Miles affirms that John Brayne provided half the cost of the Theatre, and was cheated of a share in the lease by James. Miles estimates the Burbages have made at least a thousand marks on the Theatre. Miles says he has heard Allen complain that James was a bad tenant, but only since the attempt to renew the lease, and that he has not heard Allen complain that the property was kept in bad repair.

Financial problems at the Fortune soon affected Dulwich College, the owners -- by Edward Alleyn's testamentary bequest -- of the playhouse. Dulwich College eventually took Margaret Gray, one of the Fortune tenants, to Chancery for non-payment of her share in the Fortune rents.

Alleyn requests payment for his charge of 'certain beast[s] sent from the Duke of Savoy and others,' for expenses paid out of pocket on 'an Howse, wharfe, and Docke for his Ma[jesty's] Barges,' as well as for Alleyn's annual fee and 'other services by him don by his Ma[jesty's] appoyntm[ent].'

The Crown asks furthermore whether Wistow'or Morgan Pope installed 'galleries' in the new building to take the place of the original scaffolding, where they were set, and if they were 'larger in Circuit & compasse then the fformer,' and furthermore whether they were constructed on the Bishop of Winchester's lands. \r\n\r\nOnly John Taylor responds to the question, affirming that Wistow succeeded Payne, that he continued to bait bears in the same yard, and that he took up the office some 45 years ago.

The arena houses some two hundred dogs, maintained separately in small boxes made of boards; another pen houses bears and wild bulls. Performances take place in a circular space in the middle, surrounded by stands with awnings to protect against sun and rain. People gather there on Sundays to see the dogs being trained. Entrance fees are one penny to stand below, and two pennies to go into the stands, and the entertainments last from vespers until evening. \r\n\r\nIn the course of the performance Magno attends, the dogs are used to bait -- in order -- a monkey on a horse, some bears, and a wild bull. Magno observes that this last form of baiting 'is finer to see than the others and is more dangerous for the dogs than the others, many of which are wounded and die, and it lasts until evening.'

Upon Allison's death, the executor of his estate, brewer Edward Harvest, moved to collect on Langley's debts, and Langley arranged with Gammon to settle by conveying 'the interest of the [Paris Garden] lease of 1000 years to the said Edward Harvest' for 'forty pounds yearly... during the term of 21 years', whereupon Harvest 'did regrant and convey again the residue' of the Paris Garden lease to Gammon.  According to Gammon, Langley had no intent to inform Browker of this encumbrance, and Gammon 'of his own accord informed' Browker of the transaction.  Browker nonetheless agreed to take upon the forty pounds yearly to Harvest as part of the transaction, under the provision that Langley reduce the purchase price of Paris Garden by three hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nGammon also recalls that the executor to the estate of the Paris Garden lease, the widow Anne Cure and her son Thomas, did sell him the lease 'of the said manor' early in 1590.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, Gammon recalls Francis Langley's offer for Gammon to 'leave his trade and to bring his wife and children and to dwell with him' at Paris Garden, made in response to inquiries regarding 'moneys that were due to him.' Langley went on to claim that he would repay Browker 'as he was able', and that if Gammon were to accept his offer to come to Paris Garden, 'the said Langley would never sell the said manor to the said Mr Browker or any other.'

The letter permits the viewing of private plays 'either in the Inns of Court, when the revels are, or in the King's or Queen's Court, or in the universities, or in any nobleman's or gentleman's house' because they are not produced for profit. It emphasizes that the public theaters can produce plays of wholesome quality because they must appeal to the tastes of the 'young gallants' that attend them, and that priests attending plays will appear in 'unpriestlike carriage' and thus compromise their ability to lead a spiritual community. Despite these claims, the letter withdraws the prohibition against playing to prevent further dispute among England's endangered clerics.
